"Clinical case: We present a case of a 60-year old man, without previous history of liver disease, submitted in April 2012 to a total gastrectomy due to a signet-ring cell gastric cancer (pT1N1M0), followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with EOX regimen (epirubicin, oxaliplatine and capecitabine) and surveillance. Patient was asymptomatic until January 2017 when he was admitted with acute esophageal variceal bleeding. Abdominal CT scan showed patency of portal vein, perihepatic ascites and nodular configuration of segment III (Fig. 1). Tumor markers were normal and common causes of cirrhosis were excluded. Median liver stiffness on elastography was 10.1 kPa and hepatic venous pressure gradient was 4 mmHg. A liver biopsy of segment III and of the right lobe was performed which excluded cirrhosis or neoplastic involvement (Fig. 2). Diagnosis of PSVD due to oxaliplatin was made. Conclusion: In patients treated with oxaliplatin in the presence of clinical signs of portal hypertension, the diagnosis of vascular liver disease should be considered. Findings can mimick liver neoplastic involvement as described in our case report. In this population biopsy should be pursued to exclude the diagnosis of malignancy and avoid overtreatment. The natural history of PSVD is not yet fully known but patients require screening for portal vein thrombosis and management of portal hypertension complications.

"CASE REPORT: A 59 year-old woman, with controlled fibromyalgia, complains of recurrent episodes of hemorrhagic bullae alternating between soft/hard palate and tongue since she was 25. Each episode has a single painless lesion which causes a local burning sensation and lasts 2-3 days, rupturing spontaneously with sero-hematic fluid and then completely healing in 4-5 days. There is neither recognized trigger nor seasonality. She denies relevant family history or any other major complaints. The physical examination revealed a painless tense hemorrhagic bulla in the left side of the tongue, sizing 1.5cm, with normal surrounding mucosa (Fig.1A). This lesion disappeared 7 days after it had been noticed (Fig.1B). The patient states her previous lesions had the same exact features. A biopsy was then performed, showing non-specific findings and both hematologic and immune-mediated mucocutaneous diseases were excluded. A diagnosis of angina bullosa hemorrhagica (ABH) was made.
DISCUSSION: ABH is a rare, idiopathic and benign disease, causing the sudden onset of blood-filled vesicles and bullae in the oral mucosa with no recognized cause. It is most prevalent in middle-aged and elderly individuals, without clear genre predilection and having a recurrent course in 30% of patients.1,2 It has been suggested minor subclinical trauma, dental procedures, oral anesthesics and inhaled steroids might play a role, as well as comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease, although all these were absent in our patient.1,3,4 The blisters can reach a diameter of 3cm, expanding rapidly and bursting in 24-48h, leaving a flat ulcer which heals with no sequelae.2 The soft palate is the predominant location but lesions have been reported in other locations, including tongue, oropharynx (causing airway obstruction) or even esophagus.1,4 The diagnosis is clinical and bullous diseases involving the oral cavity must be excluded. There is no specific treatment.1-4 We report this case for its atypical location and because it is important to be aware of this largely unrecognized condition."
"CASE REPORT
A 76-year-old woman, without previous pulmonary diseases or smoking habits, presented to the emergency department with 1-week history of non-productive cough, dyspnea in exercise, malaise and fever (over 38ºC). The symptoms started after a big home cleaning with exposure to dust. She denies start of new drugs and contact with birds, silica or travels. The patient was discharged medicated with doxycycline 100 mg/per day, orally for 10 days. Despite this, after 10 days, she presented clinical worsening, with dyspnea at rest and persistent fever. She returned to the emergency department. On examination, she presented fever (38.8ºC), tachypnea, saturation on room air of 80%. Pulmonary auscultation with bibasal inspiratory crackles and a decrease auscultation on the bases. Remaining clinical observation was unremarkable.
Chest radiography (Figure 1a) on admission showed areas of heterogeneous consolidation with air bronchogram, of ill-defined limits, with predominantly peripheral distribution, in the middle and lower zone of both lung fields.
On laboratory evaluation, she had leukocytosis (15,7x103/µL), neutrophilia (10,8x103/µL) and eosinophilia (1,82x103/µL). C-reactive protein was raised (147mg/dL) and procalcitonin was normal.
The patient was hospitalized with the hypothesis of acquired community pneumonia and medicated with piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5mg every 6h intravenous and oxygen therapy.
Despite the antibiotherapy, the patient presented a worsening of respiratory failure and persistence of fever (Figure 3). Chest radiography had a worsening of infiltrates (Figure 1b) and a chest computed tomography (CT) (Figure 2a) was requested, which showed an extensive bilateral consolidation with air bronchogram (alveolar filling) and bilateral ground-glass opacities and thickening of peribroncovascular soft tissue. The lesions distribution is predominantly peripheral, in the middle and lower zone of both lung fields. She presented bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and initiated therapy with High-Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO). Intravenous fluconazole 400mg/day and clarithromycin 500mg twice a day were added.
A bronchoscopy was performed with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). BAL fluid presented eosinophilia (41%) and lymphocytosis (42%), with CD4 predominance. BAL polymerase chain reaction (PCR) did not detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The culture of BAL was negative to bacteria and fungus.
Blood cultures did not show growth. Urinary antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila were negative. Serologies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Varicella-Zoster, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii, Epstein-Barr, Parvovirus B19 and Herpes Simplex were negative to active infection. Influenza A and B were negative. HIV and hepatitis virus were excluded.
Given the clinical presentation, radiological findings and eosinophilic infiltration in BAL, a final diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia was made. The patient was medicated with corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 125mg every 6 hours during 3 days followed by Prednisolone 1mg/kg/day).
After 3 days of corticosteroid therapy the patient had a significant improvement, with reduction on oxygen support, and was transfer to pneumology department. Radiologic re-evaluation demonstrated a significant reduction of the opacities (Figure 1c). The patient was discharged on the 10th day of prednisolone. She was medicated with oxygen 2L/minute 24hours/day and prednisolone 40mg/day.
One month later, the patient presented complete resolution of respiratory failure and a significant improvement in the chest radiography (Figure 1d). The corticosteroid tapering was initiated.
Three months after discharge, the patient remained asymptomatic. Computed tomography was performed (Figure 2b) and showed small areas of parenchymal densification with nearly complete resolution of the inflammatory process.
DISCUSSION"
"CLINICAL CASE
A 53-years-old woman, with history of anxiety, chronic cough and an isolated episode of supraventricular arrhythmia, was referred to our hospital with analytical changes in the cholestasis liver enzymes. She denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal disorders, anorexia, weight loss or other symptoms. No report of alcohol consumption or illicit drugs abuse. She denied the use of herbal products, antibiotics, analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
The patient had no relevant pathological observations on physical examination. Her body mass index was 24.2Kg/m2. Laboratory tests showed increased alkaline phosphatase (AP) - 111 U/L (reference value 33-98) and gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT)106 U/L (reference value 5-36) with normal transaminases, bilirrubin, albumin, INR and prothrombin time.
We conducted a deeper investigation with hepatotropic viruses serology, autoimmune study, iron metabolism, lipidic profile, protein immunoelectrophoresis, ceruloplasmin and alpha-1-antitrypsin assay which proved normal. Ultrasound showed a normal size liver, with a heterogeneous structural pattern, outlining some cystic elements, the larger with about 2mm. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy requested to rule out portal hypertension was normal.
A colangio-MRI (magnetic resonance image) was requested to clarify the previously described images on ultrasound. The study identified the presence of numerous nodulariform configuration images (figures1,2 and 3), hyper-intense on T2-weighted sequences, consistent with nodular cystic millimeter elements, related to the presence of MBH.
We performed no specific treatment and fluctuation on AP and GGT values was observed, never higher than 124 U/L for AP and 122 U/L for GGT.
Our patient maintains an annual surveillance with clinical, analytical and imaging control.
DISCUSSION"
"Case Description:
A 65-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with generalized pruritic exanthema and fever during the previous 3 days. She had a history of arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia, and was chronically taking nifedipine, perindopril associated with indapamide, simvastatin and aspirin. Three weeks previously to the incident, the patient began treatment with allopurinol for recently diagnosed hyperuricemia. On physical examination at admission she was febrile (39.8ºC) and a maculopapular generalized rash was noted (figures 1 and 2). There was no evidence of mucous membrane involvement, lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Blood tests showed no alterations on leukocyte counts; serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.2), serum urea level of 88 mg/dL (normal range: 16-42), alanine and aspartate aminotransferases values of 386 and 201 IU/L (normal range: 3-31) respectively, alkaline phosphatase of 319 IU/L (normal range 25-100), gamma-glutamyl transferase of 259 IU/L(normal range 4-32), with normal bilirubin values.
Supportive therapy was provided, and allopurinol was suspended. At the third day of hospitalization, peripheral blood eosinophilia developed (2800/mm3) and the diagnosis of DRESS syndrome was made (Figure 3). Systemic corticosteroid therapy with oral prednisolone (1mg/Kg/day) was started. Daily analytic controls revealed progressive liver function deterioration. Renal involvement was documented by presence of leucocituria and 24-hour proteinuria of 1.29 g without further increase in serum urea nitrogen or creatinine levels.
The patient was then treated with a course of pulsed methylprednisolone (1000 mg intravenously for 3 days) with subsequent clinical and analytical improvement (Figure 4).
After 2 weeks of corticosteroid treatment and complete resolution of cutaneous lesions, the patient was discharged. She was kept on steroid therapy in tapered dosages for an additional 2 months.
Further blood workup excluded autoimmune causality. Reactivation of human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) by polymerase chain reaction was posteriorly confirmed by detection of HHV-6 DNA by polymerase chain reaction and increased titers of IgG anti-HHV-6.
One year later, the patient remains asymptomatic with normal laboratory results.

"CASE DESCRIPTION
A 65-year-old caucasian woman presents with a four-month history of fatigue, anorexia, nausea, unprovoked weight loss of about 10 Kg and confusion. She had history of systemic arterial hypertension and chronic depression medicated with enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide 20mg/12.5mg and sertraline 50mg. She denied night sweats, fever, dysuria, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, or others. She had pale skin and mucous membranes, was slightly dehydrated, had normal vital signs and there were no palpable lymphadenopathies or organomegalies.
Blood tests (all described at Table 1) showed a new onset anaemia (haemoglobin of 10.9g/dL), lymphopenia (count of 600/μL), acute kidney injury (creatinine 3.4mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen 141mg/dL) and a markedly elevated serum calcium level of 16,6 mg/dL (corrected to 16.92mg/dL). Previous recent renal function was normal. Urinalysis showed calcium oxalate crystals. Intensive hydration was promptly initiated jointly with a bisphosphonate, as well as corticoid therapy due to multiple myeloma suspicion. Further haematological studies revealed low iron and iron saturation and normal transferrin, total iron binding capacity and ferritin. Beta-2 microglobulin was elevated but serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation were normal. As these findings were against our first hypothesis of multiple myeloma, corticoids were discontinued after three days. Regarding hypercalcaemia, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were low (4.0pg/mL and 10.7ng/mL, respectively) and 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D level was elevated (75,0pg/mL); PTH related protein (PTHrp) was indetectable and hypercalciuria was present.
A renal ultrasound showed normal parenchyma and no signs of lithiasis. A thoracoabdominal-pelvic CT (Fig. 1) showed multiple small coalescent lymphadenopathies in mediastinum and hilar regions, multiple micronodules with a perilymphatic distribution associated with interlobular septae thickening; a slightly enlarged homogenous liver and spleen and multiple millimetric mesenteric and lombo-aortic lymphadenopathies. In this setting, lung biopsies were performed showing chronic non-caseating granulomatous inflammatory process with no signs of malignity (Fig. 1). Bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy also showed multiple non-caseating granulomas and was otherwise normocellular with trilineage haematopoiesis (Fig. 2). Fungal and acid-fast stains of both biopsies were negative. Angiotensin-converting enzyme was elevated (97U/L) and an extensive immunologic and infectious work-up was negative (Table 1). Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) revealed a metabolic active disease within the lungs (multiple bilateral parenchyma densification areas), mediastinum and hilar lymphadenopathies, spleen, bone marrow and possibly liver, suggesting an inflammatory/granulomatous disease (Fig. 3). Ophthalmic, cardiac, and neurologic sarcoidosis were excluded, by optical coherence tomography, FDG-PET/CT and cranial MRI, respectively. We also documented new onset violaceous skin plaques at the elbows and knees (Fig. 4) by the 10th day of hospitalization which were biopsied and showed non-caseating granulomas.
In the setting of multisystemic sarcoidosis methylprednisolone pulses were initiated (1g/day for 3 days) followed by prednisolone 1mg/kg/day. There was an excellent clinical and analytic response with normalization of calcium, haemoglobin, and renal function.
At follow-up, methotrexate was initiated as a corticoid-sparing agent due to corticoid tapering difficulties and related secondary effects (new-onset diabetes mellitus). Otherwise, our patient maintains a good clinical and analytical evolution.
DISCUSSION"
"CASE DESCRIPTION:
We describe a 51-years-old woman who arrived at our internal medicine clinic with excruciating pain, which began two years earlier and had progressively disabled her. The patient was being studied by six specialties, including neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, family medicine, rheumatology and cardiology. Moreover, she had thirty different prescriptions for symptomatic management, without pain control or definite diagnosis (Table 2).
Personal history included epilepsy since 18-years-old, secondary to cranio-encephalic trauma, and hypertension since the age of 40 years, while the only previous surgery was a C5-C6 hernia discectomy two years earlier. The patient was medicated with losartan 100mg, topiramate 25mg, naproxen 500mg twice daily and pregabalin 300mg twice daily and had a documented penicillin allergy, without relevant family background.
Symptoms included pain in the cervical, dorsal and lumbar spine, with irradiation to the four limbs. Pain was described as burning, stinging and tearing sensation, and exacerbated with limb movement, touch and at night. Neurologic examination revealed hyperalgesia and hyperesthesia in stocking and glove pattern, decreased muscle strength (4/5 in four limbs) and limb movement reduction due to pain and edema, without ataxia and with preserved neurologic reflexes. Autonomic symptoms included colder hands and feet, with redness and edema and episodes of increased sweating described by the patient. Physical examination reported atrophic skin and contracted joints, particularly elbows and knees. These alterations motivated many falls with trauma, leading to a high rate of urgency admissions. The patient denied other symptoms, such as arthritis, xerostomia, xerophthalmia, alopecia, history of thrombosis, rash, chest pain, mouth or genital ulcers, and other respiratory, gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms.
According to the patient, symptoms began on the immediate post-operative of a C5-C6 discectomy, two years previously, with progressive worsening and numerous prescriptions causing adverse effects, most frequently nausea, fever and diarrhea. The patient reported intolerance to duloxetine, tapentadol, etoricoxib, deflazacort and amitriptyline.
These prolonged incapacitating symptoms, mainly uncontrolled pain, and absence of a diagnosis, lead this patient to a major depression with suicidal ideation.
Despite several exams the patient remained without a diagnosis. (Table 3)
Considering that the clinical presentation, the evolution and the complementary diagnostic exams were not supporting any specific diagnosis, our diagnostic hypothesis was complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) involving the four limbs.
The pain seemed disproportionate in time and degree to the usual course of any known lesion, was not specific of any nerve territory or dermatome and had abnormal sensory, motor, vasomotor and atrophic findings with distal predominance.1,7
As there is no gold-standard method for diagnosis, CRPS is a clinical diagnosis.4 Using the Budapest criteria, the patient met at least one symptom and one sign of the four categories required and, obviously, the continuing pain which was disproportionate to the inciting event. Regarding the sensory category, the patient reported hyperesthesia and allodynia as major symptom. In the clinic, excruciating pain was provoked with light touch, passive joint movement and pinprick. In the vasomotor category, the patient reported different temperatures between the extremities of limbs and the rest of the body, and objectively they were colder and flushed (Figs 1 and 2). In reference to the sudomotor/edema category, hands, feet and the inferior 1/3 of both legs were edematous (Figs 1 and 2). The patient also complained about sweating changes but it was not observed in consultation. Concerning the motor/trophic category, she presented weakness of the four limbs that hindered mobility and daily tasks like writing or even eating. The Budapest criteria also takes into account that no other diagnosis better explains these signs and symptoms.
The differential diagnosis of CRPS is made with: Skin, muscle, joint or bone infections, excluded by clinical history and absence of inflammatory parameters elevation on blood analyses; Compartment syndrome, not compatible with the history of this patient; Peripheral vascular disease or deep vein thrombosis, which are very rare to manifest simultaneously on the four limbs and were not supported by the Echo-Doppler of the inferior limbs; Peripheral neuropathy, discarded by normal EMG; Chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, such as systemic erythematous lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, excluded by clinical history, absence of arthritis and blood analysis (negative anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anticitrullinated protein antibody and anti-dsDNA antibody, and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein); Raynaud syndrome, rejected because the vascular manifestations were permanent and did not worsen with cold; Secondary erythromelalgia, discarded by the lack of changes with temperature fluctuations.7,9
Even though CRPS diagnosis is clinical, recently bone scintigraphy was pointed as a sensitive technique to support this diagnosis when preformed within the first five months, showing increased radiotracer uptake near the region of interest. Unfortunately, symptoms were present for two years.4
Assuming this diagnosis in agreement with a multidisciplinary pain unit, we referred the patient to a pain consultation with previous experience with CRPS, for symptom management. Although, therapeutic approaches have been increasing in the past few years evidence is still controversial. The treatment of CRPS is composed by three main frames: physical and occupational therapy, psychological therapy, and pharmacological (non-steroid anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids, bisphosphonates, neuropathic pain medication, ketamine infusion, intravenous immunoglobulin, epidural clonidine, compound analgesic cream, opioids, anticonvulsants and antidepressants) and surgical interventions to manage pain.7 Surgical interventions, namely spinal cord stimulation, were considered due to the severity of the case, prolonged evolution and lack of control of the pain with multiple drugs and intolerance to several others that lead to low treatment compliance. The patient was also, referenced to a psychiatric consultation and physical therapy.8 At pain unit she was medicated with multiple pain control drugs, gradually, until reaching reasonable pain control that allowed her to cooperate with physical rehabilitation sessions  Codeine/paracetamol 30/500mg three times daily, Phenytoin 100mg two times daily, Pregabalin 300mg twice daily, Metamizol 575mg daily, Clonazepam 0,5mg daily, Venlafaxine 150mg daily, cyclobenzaprine 10mg daily, Acemetacin 90mg twice daily and Trazodone 150mg daily. Fortunately, the patient is making favorable progresses with the multidisciplinary approach and surgical intervention was postponed.

"Case presentation
A 38 year old African Woman born and living in Angola without any known previous medical condition was transferred to a Portuguese hospital due to productive cough, dyspnoea, thoracalgia, overt asthenia and oedema of the face and neck over a 5 month period. The patient reported generalised cutaneous pruritus, which worsened at night and with hot baths, weight loss of over 10 kg in 3-4 months, anorexia without gastrointestinal discomfort. She reported no history of nocturnal diaphoresis, no palpable adenopathy in the neck or inguinal area as well as no fever. A previous analytical evaluation from Angola showed anaemia with 7,9 g/dL of haemoglobin, a C-reactive protein of 36.6 mg/L, a normal leucogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 42 mm/h, and uric-acid of 7 mg/dl with no liver function or renal function abnormalities.
On admission the patient appeared tired, with signs of weight loss, afebrile, blood pressure 137/77 mmHg, the pulse was 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 94-95% breathing ambient air. Her right jugular vein was distended with swelling of the face, neck and arms on the right side. Pulmonary auscultation showed decreased breath sounds in the lower half of the right hemithorax and in this area percussion also revealed dullness. The abdominal examination revealed hepatomegaly with a soft liver that was palpable 4 centimetres below the right costal margin with an enlarged palpable spleen 2 centimetres below the left costal margin. No peripheral adenopathy was identified and the remainder physical examination was unremarkable.
Immediate serology for HIV type 1 and 2 was negative (ELISA Essay), Hepatitis B and C were negative as well as Treponema Pallidum antibody. Epstein - Barr virus viral load and Human Herpes Virus-8 were also negative and no immunoglobulin peaks were found on electrophoresis with a Beta 2- microglobulin of 2.13mg/l.
Transthoracic Echocardiography showed an echogenic mass in the right heart with an enlarged inferior Vena Cava but without evidence of thrombus inside the vessel. A caudal dislodgement of the heart by a mass without defined borders in the location of the large vessels was seen as well as a small pericardial effusion larger at the right ventricle.
A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed an anterior mediastinal mass, lateralized to the right, with apparent epicentre above the cardiac area, causing a contralateral deviation of the mediastinum. The mass was lobulated with ill-defined borders measuring 12x10x12 cm with a lower density centre which was suggestive of necrosis. Invasion of the right atrium with extension to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve was also observed invading also the interatrial septum while incarcerating the right pulmonary artery. The superior vena cava was also enveloped causing obstruction with thrombosis of both troncular brachiocephalic veins, the right and left subclavian veins and the internal right jugular vein, with exuberant collateral venous circulation.
The bone marrow aspirate had no remarkable abnormalities but no genetic analysis was performed or immunophenotyping and a biopsy of the mass was performed by thoracotomy which the preliminary biopsy report suggested a non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. As such the patient was transferred to a Haematology ward where she started R-CHOP
(Figure 1). An initial CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed an expansive solid ill-defined mass (9.3x8.4x11.0 cm) of the mediastinum invading the right heart and vascular structures.
The final biopsy report described a dense and diffuse proliferation of small lymphoid cells, with round nucleus filled with clumped chromatin with some larger cells with obvious nucleolus with loose clumps. Residual dendritic follicular cells were found by CD21 marker with a proliferative index around 40%. The immunohistochemistry of the neoplastic cells showed immunoreactivity to CD20, CD23, CD43 and in a smaller number to bcl-2 and CD10 (weak and focal staining), those cells were negative to CD5, cyclin D1, CD21, CD138 and bcl-6.The biopsy material was then sent for molecular assessment to search for the MyD88 marker or translocation t(11,18) but both were negative.
The pathological examination conclusion was that the mass was a Non-Hodgkin B Lymphoma of small cells with lymphoplasmacytic differentiation which could be a Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma, an extraganglionic Marginal Zone Lymphoma or Lymphocytic Lymphoma and required further material for a more definite diagnosis.
After the final pathological results and completing the first cycle of R-CHOP the patient was discharged to ambulatory treatment in day-hospital where she completed 8 cycles R7CHOP8.
A repeat CT scan of the neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis after the 8 cycles showed a significant reduction of volume with the mass now measuring 8 x 6.5 x 8.5 cm with central necrosis and still invading the right atrium, although less expressive and with no extension to the right ventricle but still involving the thoracic vascular structures.Figures 2. After this exam the patient returned to her home country with the final diagnosis of LPL, stage IIE with partial response to treatment and follow up was lost.
Discussion"
"Case report
A 43-year old male with mitral valve prolapse and mild mitral regurgitation (MR) was admitted to our hospital with fever, asthenia, anorexia and weight loss (of about 10% of his body weight) persisting for 4 weeks. Three months before admission he has been submitted to a dental procedure.
On admission, he was febrile (tympanic temperature 38,2ºC) but hemodynamically stable. The examination showed a grade III/VI systolic murmur in the mitral area. No petechiae, splinter haemorrhages, Janeways lesions or Oslers nodes were observed. Fundoscopic examination was normal. Laboratory studies revealed normocytic anaemia (Hb 8.9g/dL), with a leucocyte count of 11980/mL (neutrophil 89%), C-reactive protein of 83 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 101 mm in the first hour and normal ferritin. Sequential transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms showed left atrial enlargement, preserved global ventricular function and a vegetation attached to the ventricular surface of the mitral valve (Figure 1) and severe MR (Figure 2).
Despite antibiotic treatment adapted to the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, severe MR remained present and mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve was performed with complete disease resolution. No valve abcess was reported and valve culture was negative. After 60 days the patient was discharged home and was doing well at the last follow-up 12 months after surgery."
"CLINICAL CASE
We present the case of a 64 year old woman, non-smoker, with several non-severe respiratory infections (sputum and blood cultures were negative) in a period of 3 years that needed ambulatory antibiotic treatment. Thoracic-CT (Fig. 1) showed a left nodular lesion with 10 cm of diameter, that was biopsied revealing a thymoma.
During hospitalization, she remained asymptomatic, apyretic, hemodynamically stable, with normal pulmonary auscultation, without suplemental oxygen and completed 2 blood units without complications.
The analytic evaluation uncovered a normocytic normochromic anemia (Hb 5.7 g/dL). Haptoglobin, Coombs direct and indirect test were negative. From the remaining laboratory study: medulogram with pure red cell aplasia, hyperplasia of the lymphoid series, immunophenotyping with 70% lymphoid population, increased T cell markers, absence of B cell markers (CD 19 and CD 20 0%); autoimmunity (Anti-Nuclear, Anti-dsDNA, Anti-Nucleossomes, Anti-Smooth Muscle and Anti-Ribossomes antibodies) remained negative, hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG 198 mg/dL, IgA <24mg/dL, IgM <17.5mg/dL). Viral serologies (Immunodeficiency virus, Cytomegalovirus, B and C hepatitis), tumor markers, cultures and parasitological feces exams were negative. Upper digestive endoscopy and colonoscopy were normal and thoracic-abdominal-pelvic-CT didnt reveal any other lesions.
The patient initiated 600 mg/kg/dose infusion of human intravenous immunoglobulin for 48 hours. After normalization of the values of IgG (IgG>600 mg/dL) she was submitted to surgery, with removal of the mediastinical mass. To this date, the patient continues with IgG levels within normal limit, the number of respiratory infections and antibiotic use has decreased, but still needs continuing blood transfusions to treat the anaemia.
DISCUSSION"
"Case Report:
A male patient, 46 years old, with a previous hospital admission for hypovolemic shock. Lung exam revealed no air flow on the right side and the patient complained of epigastric pain on abdominal palpation.
Chest radiograph and an abdominal ultrasound showed an extensive right pleural effusion. A thoracic drain was placed with output of hematic pleural effusion. (Figure 1) A thoracic computed tomography (TCT) was also performed that confirmed the presence of a right massive hemothorax.
During surgery, it appeared that the massive right hemothorax was secondary to an apparent spontaneous venous rupture of a right diaphragmatic vein. This vein had a distended, aneurysmatic morphology. The vein was lacquered and the patient was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
The patient denied any precipitating factors, including violent physical exertion, alcoholic habits or known vascular malformations. To study this event, the patient repeated TCT and performed a thoracoabdominal magnetic resonance angiography. These imaging studies did not show any vascular malformation or portal hypertension.
After 5 days in ICU, the patient continued care in the surgery ward. The patient progressed favorably and after 11 days of hospitalization, he met conditions for hospital discharge.
Four years later, the patient was referred to an Internal Medicine consult for persistent thrombocytopenia, presenting since the previous episode. Blood workup revealed positive lupus anticoagulant and high levels of anti-β-2glycoprotein-I antibody. (Table I) He denied a history of thrombotic events.
During the follow up consult, the patient repeated the analytical study after 12 weeks, which revealed high levels of anti-β-2glycoprotein-I antibody, additionally demonstrating mildly elevated liver enzymes. The remaining blood work, including coagulation evaluation, autoimmunity and assessment of overall thrombotic risk factor, proved negative. (Table I) The echocardiography did not show significant changes.
Due to the elevated liver enzymes, an abdominal ultrasound was performed that did not expose significant changes. An abdominal computed tomography was then requested that presented alterations suggestive of chronic BCS: complete occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) at the diaphragm; caudate lobe hypertrophy with periportal edema; ectasia of the hepatic, port, azygos and hemiazygos veins; esophageal and right diaphragm varices; mild splenomegaly. (Figure 2-4) Hepatic ecodoppler corroborated the hypothesis of BCS. An upper digestive endoscopy was performed, which did not reveal any signs of portal hypertension.
The first imaging studies carried out were reviewed and compared with the current ones. At that time, some of the structural changes suggestive of BCS were already present, but were not valued in that clinical context. This process has become chronic, so currently the imaging studies show alterations suggestive of chronic BCS.
The patient presented with thrombocytopenia, confirmed high levels of anti-β-2glycoprotein-I antibody and a thrombotic event revealed by BCS. BCS was the presenting manifestation of APS.
Presently, the patient is medicated with warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0) and has been referred to a gastroenterology consultation.

"Clinical case
A previously healthy 31-years-old white-European man was admitted in July of 2017 to the emergency department, with a 5 days history of intense headache, chills, fever (39ºC), myalgia and arthralgia, with no other symptoms. He denied any use of medications, tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. He was born and lived all his life in a rural village. The patient reported engagement in agricultural works and direct contact with a vaccinated dog and cat. There was no history of tick or flea bite, foreign travel or ingestion of row meat or unpasteurized milk.
On examination he appeared sweaty, feverish (39,7ºC), and it was identified splenomegaly of about 3 cm below the costal margins, with no palpable lymph nodes.
The patient´s laboratory results (Image 1) revealed bicytopenia (lymphopenia with thrombocytopenia) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). It was also detected elevated liver function tests (LFTs) with mild hyperbilirubinemia, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and low fibrinogen - 126 mg/dl. Serologies for Mycoplasma, Brucella, Legionella, Borrelia, Salmonella, Q fever, spotted fever, HIV, EBV, CMV, hepatitis A, B, and C, parvovirus B19, Leishmania, Hantavirus, Toxoplasma, Bartonella henselae and West Nile were all negative. Multiple cultures of blood and urine were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi. He was admitted to the in-patient internal medicine department and started on empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone 2g once daily.
The patient continued to have daily spiking fevers and sweats, with worsening of the cytopenias, coagulation defects and LFTs. A generalized maculopapular rash sparing the face, palms and plants appeared on the 2nd day. This new clinical manifestation, together with the existence of an epidemiological context, led to the association of Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily.
No improvement of clinical status was observed. On the contrary, we identified hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2= 280), aggravation of cytopenias, LFTs and of LDH. The chest-abdomen-pelvis computed tomography showed interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, mild pleural and pericardial effusion (Image 2 and 3), homogeneously enlarged liver and spleen (Image 4) and the echocardiography revealed mild pericardial effusion with normal ventricular function and no valvular abnormalities. Additional blood tests showed significant increase of serum ferritin and triglycerides (TG); the autoimmune study was negative (including anti-nuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmatic antibody, anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies) as well as direct Coombs test. The patient refused spleen or bone marrow biopsy. He was transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), on the 3rd day of hospital admission, with the diagnosis of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome and initiated systemic steroids- Prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day, with improvement of the bicytopenia, LFTs, LDH, ESR and CRP. However, on the 3th day after admission to ICU the young man presented blurred and diminished vision, suggestive of retinal vasculitis on fundus fluorescein angiography and the dose of Prednisolone was increased to 1mg/kg/day. The patient became completely asymptomatic 5 days after the admission to ICU. A course of 7 days of Ceftriaxone and 5 days of Doxycycline was completed. An autoimmune disorder or a secondary HS was suspected. So, a new diagnostic workup was made, including serum level of sCD25, this one elevated (5139 pg/mL), and serology for Brucella, MSF, EBV and CMV, all of these with pending results at the time of discharge. He returned to the Internal Medicine Ward on 20 mg/day of Prednisolone and he was discharged from the hospital 19 days after admission, with no abnormalities on physical examination or blood tests, and invited to a follow up consultation 2 weeks after the discharge. One week after the discharge he returned to the emergency department with milder headache and low fever. The physical examination was irrelevant and the blood tests showed mild thrombocytopenia, elevated ESR and CRP (Table 1). The review of the serological tests from the previous episode revealed positive IgM antibodies to Rickettsia conorii; Doxycycline was restarted and a course of 14 days was completed. A complete resolution of symptoms occurred within 3 days and complete withdrawal of steroids was made 1 month after this episode. Four weeks after the illness onset, the IgG titer to Rickettsia conorii showed a rise more than four-fold of normal value.
Hence, the diagnosis of MSF was confirmed and criteria of HS, the last one secondary to Rickettsiose, were fulfilled.
Currently the patient maintains follow up in the out-patient ward of Internal Medicine, he remains absolutely asymptomatic and drug-free. Recent imagiological exam revealed no serositis or hepatosplenomegaly.

"Case report
Patient showed widespread erythematous rash and cutaneous nodules around arms and abdomen over a period of 2 months characterized by non tender, non pruritic papules and erythemato-violaceous nodules, 0.5 cm in diameter (fig 1-2). No palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy nor history of reported night sweats or weight loss. Peripheral blood smear revealed 76% neutrophilia, 2% myelocytes and 8% rods. Punch biopsy of the lesions was taken and submitted for pathologic evaluation. The histopathological study showed skin infiltration by atypical cells in the epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue with a perivascular pattern. Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse positivity for CD20, CD79α and Bcl2 neoplastic cells, with heterogeneous and focal positivity for ACL, MUM1, Bcl6, PAX5 and CD23. Biopsy was suggestive lymphoid B cell neoplasia involvement. Systemic disease was excluded.

"Case Description:
The authors present the case of a 42 year-old woman who attended the emergency department complaining of palpitations and general malaise that had begun suddenly that same day. The patient denied fever, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or altered consciousness. She also denied suffering similar episodes in the past.
The patient had a history of WPW syndrome and unspecified thyroid disease. She was on no regular medication.
In initial assessment, the was afebrile, normotensive (arterial pressure: 100/78 mmHg) but tachycardic (Heart rate: 140-300 beats per minute). She showed no signs of respiratory distress, with peripheral oxygen saturation of 96% at room air. Cardiac auscultation confirmed tachycardic and arrhythmic heart sounds but no heart murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation was symmetrical and there were no abnormal respiratory sounds. Lower limbs showed no signs of edema or diminished peripheral perfusion.
Initial EKG revealed AF with rapid ventricular rate (160 to 300 beats per minute), with alternate conduction between accessory and normal pathways (Fig. 1).
Given the high risk of degeneration to VF, it was decided to perform urgent electrical cardioversion, and a 200 J electric shock was delivered. Post-cardioversion EKG showed sinus rhythm with signs of ventricular pre-excitation (Fig. 2).
During hospitalization, a thorough study was performed, including blood tests with thyroid function that were normal.
Transthoracic cardiac ultrasound ruled out functional and morphological alterations, such as Ebsteins anomaly.6
An electrophysiology study was also performed, which included ablation of the accessory pathway identified in the right posterior septal region.

"Case Presentation
A 57-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ER) of our hospital complaining of pain, swelling and erythema near the left SCJ. His medical history was almost unremarkable, except for an asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis and a cystostomy due to urethral stenosis. His family history was non-contributory, there was no record or stigma of intravenous drug use. CT of the chest described an eventual ongoing process of cellulitis surrounding the left paramanubrial area. At this time the patient was discharged with a 7-day course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate.
Two months later, he returned to the ER with persistent symptoms, in addition to progressive restricted abduction of his left shoulder, weight loss of 7kg, chills and diaphoresis. The physical examination revealed a tympanic temperature of 38.1ºC, tachycardia and an holosystolic murmur. Inflammatory signs were visible near the left SCJ with edema, erythema and warmth. His blood results revealed a normocytic anemia, leukopenia, elevated C reactive protein level (CRP) of 75 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 62 mm/h and urine analysis with leukocyturia. The patient was admitted for further studies. Repeat chest CT (Fig. 1) revealed structural bone irregularities with lytic and erosive subchondral lesions on the left SCJ. Serology tests for HIV, Tuberculosis and Brucellosis were all negative. Blood and urine cultures were both positive for an EF with the same antibiotype.

We ordered a CT-guided bone biopsy of the left SCJ lesions (Fig. 2), but incidentally the sample was not sent for microbiology and gram stain analysis, not being possible to isolate the agent. However, we managed to have the anatomopathological study, reporting findings suggestive of clavicular osteomyelitis with acute inflammatory areas and fibrous exudate. Transthoracic echocardiogram was negative for vegetative lesions or other signs of concomitant endocarditis.
(Inserir figura nº 2 aqui)
We assumed the diagnosis of sternoclavicular septic arthritis, complicated with osteomyelitis due to an EF bacteremia. The patient was started on directed antibiotic treatment with intravenous gentamicin (320mg/day) and ampicillin (2g/4h) for four weeks. Suprapubic cystostomy was replaced by the Urology team. During this period of treatment, both CRP and ESR level decreased progressively, in addition to complete resolution of symptoms. After 30 days of hospitalization for IV antibiotics, he was discharged on an additional two weeks of oral amoxicillin (1g/8h). On the follow-up visit, one month later, he did not show any signs of recurrence and inflammatory markers remained negative. Surgical debridement was not necessary.
Discussion"
"Case presentation: The authors present the case of a 72-year-old male, with history of heavy alcohol consumption and no chronic prescribed medication. Ten days prior to admission, the patient was medicated with Amoxicilin and clavulanic acid and Aceclofenac for a dental abscess, with complete remission. One week later, presented with generalized muscular weakness, predominant in the lower limbs, and asthenia. He was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department with acute toxic hepatitis (ALT 564U/L, AST 2354U/L) due to excessive intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, associated with severe rhabdomyolysis (creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 25.129U/L), acute renal failure (Creatinine 2,12mg/dL, RIFLE R) and hyperkaliemia (6,00mmol/L).
At admission, the patient weighed 93kg, with a body mass index of 30,37kg/m2. Physical examination showed multiple large lipomas, symmetrically distributed in upper and lower back, shoulders, arms and abdominal wall, sparing the neck (figures 1, 2 and 3). In the abdominal wall, most of the lipomas had an average side of 15cm, with a maximum diameter of 23cm. The biggest lipoma was in the upper back, with 30cm of larger diameter. On the lower back, the patient present two large lipomas, with 20cm of diameter.
During hospitalization, the patient maintained intensive fluid therapy and eviction of hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic drugs, presenting full recovery at the time of discharge. The patient wasnt proposed for surgical treatment of the lipomatosis by own option. Maintenance of alcoholic avoidance and suspension of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were recommended.
Discussion: MSL is characterized by symmetric, diffuse, painless, non-encapsulated and irreversible growth of lipomas.1 As said, the etiology of this disease is unknow. However, there is new evidence of influence of mitochondrial disorder of brown fat tissue, or a defect in adrenergic stimulated lipolysis.1,5 The alcohol impact on fat storage and development of lipomas seems to be related to changes it induces in β-adrenergic receptors as a cofactor, hampering β-oxidation and promoting liponeogenesis.6"
"CASE REPORT
A 42 year-old caucasian male, with a combination of sickle cell and beta thalassemia mutation (HbS/β Thalassemia), presented for LT.
At the age of 3 he was diagnosed with a compound heterozygous condition in which the inheritance of HbS mutated allele from one parent and a beta-zero thalassemic mutated allele (β0Thal) from the other (HBB:c.118C>T), resulted in a total abolishment of Hb A production. He presented basal Hb values of 8 g/dL with HbS>80%.
His medical history revealed about two painful vaso-occlusive crises per year and frequent respiratory infections. At the age of 7 years a splenectomy was performed and at 33 years, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He tested negative for HBV, HCV and HIV.
His RBC phenotype was A Rh+ CCDee K- and he was regularly transfused with identical RBC. In 2010, antibody screening, using a DiaClon test IgG gel card (Bio-Rad Laboratories, DiaMed GmbH), revealed RBC alloantibodies that were identified as anti-Jka and anti-Kpa. The patient phenotype was Jka and Kpa negative.
An iron chelation program was initiated after 20 RBC units transfusion, with irregular adherence. In 2016 magnetic resonance imaging showed a liver iron concentration of 250 µmol Fe/g; he also presented a mildly dilated myocardiopathy with normal ventricular function.
In July 2016, SCIC was diagnosed with jaundice and anorexia and total bilirubin of 40.39 mg/dl, evolving to acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). He was placed on waiting list for LT (MELD score: 27; Child-Pugh:C).
The peritransplant management included regular partial manual EBT to maintain HbS<30% and Hb around 8-10 g/dl. LT from an ABO type identical adult cadaveric donor was performed 31 days after admission. In Table I, we present a summary of laboratory values at the time of LT.
The graft liver was transplanted using the piggy-back technique after 6 hours of cold ischemia. LT duration was 5h30m with a warm ischemia of 25 minutes. Immunosuppression was initiated with Basiliximab intraoperative, in the anhepatic phase, and a second dose was administered at day 4 after LT.
During surgery, as the use of cell salvage was contraindicated, the patient was transfused with 21 RBC units, 24 units of fresh frozen plasma, 1 unit of platelet concentrate pool. All RBCs transfused were HbS and Jka negative. Due to the non-elective nature of the surgery, it was not possible to obtain an entirely phenotypically matched blood stock for this patient. Therefore, he was transfused with 3 RBC units positive for antigen c and one for E; 10 days after LT, anti-c and anti-E alloantibodies were detected.
During the postoperative period his HbS remained between 3% and 16.2%. Immunosuppressive regimen post-LT included Tacrolimus and Prednisolone. Biopsy of the explanted liver showed cirrhosis with abundant iron deposits. Early postoperative course was complicated by acute renal failure. Enterococcus Faecium was isolated from bile fluid and Klebsiella pneumoniae from biliary drainage insertion site, successfully treated with vancomycin and meropenem, respectively.
The patient was discharged 23 days after surgery and remained well 14 months after LT, despite two hospitalizations for respiratory infections and one for intensive IV quelation therapy. He remains under surveillance by the Haematology and Hepatology Departments, to evaluate the need for EBT and to manage side effects of immunosuppression, respectively.

"THE CASE:
We present a 76-year-old independent woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia. Her chronic medication was irrelevant. No hereditary diseases or smoking habits were reported.At the age of 68 years old a 3-months pancerebellar syndrome forced her to move to her sons house. She presented left predominance gait ataxia, difficulties with high-precision manual tasks, 4 limb dysmetria and slight dysarthria. There was no toxic exposition nor new drugs prescribed. Her laboratory results are in Table 1 and 2.Her electroencephalogram, head computed tomography (CT), brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal. The thoracic and abdominopelvic CT, pelvic ecography, mammography and colonoscopy revealed no relevant findings. The positron emission tomography (PET) showed hyperfixation in her right posterior inferior lung. An extemporaneous biopsy revealed a bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma. The mass was removed through partial lobectomy which confirmed the diagnosis. The TNM classification was T1N0M0 and no further treatments were offered.After surgery she could walk without help and regained full autonomy. Six months later new-onset walk unsteadiness and worsening dysarthria forced her to return to her son´s house. New PET and thoracic abdominal pelvic CT scan were performed and no evidence of cancer was found. Her brain CT showed cerebellar atrophy. After two cycles of Human Immunoglobulins with no improvement, treatment with methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide (daily 1 g for 3 days) for 3 months was tried with partial response. However she could not live alone again. Clinical stability was achieved for 2 months but her dysarthria and ataxia began worsening. There was no clear response to rituximab (one cycle of 375 mg/m2 for 3 months, after approval by the Hospital Ethics Committee) nor to a new cycle of methylprednisone (1 g). Her dysarthria improved significantly and her gait had a slight recovery after plasmapheresis (3 days per week during a month and then weekly for 2 months) and a cycle of rituximab with plasmapheresis. She was also under motor rehabilitation.After one year, a new relapse determined intensive plasmapheresis (daily for 5 days) and she began mophetil mycophenolate (slowing increasing doses until 1,5 gr daily) with clinical stability until now (Fig. 1)

"Case Report
We present the case of a 72-year-old caucasian male, with previous history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, aortic prosthetic mechanical valve (replaced due to symptomatic aortic stenosis 4 years before) and hip replacement surgery 3 months before. He had no history of toxics abuse.
He was admitted in the emergency room (ER) complaining of a 3-day lasting right inferior thoracic pain, fever and dry cough. He also had a 10% weight loss in the previous three months. At admission he had normal vital signs: BP 123/62mmHg; HR 68bpm; Temperature 37.2ºC; SpO2 98% (FiO2 21%). The physical exam was irrelevant except for the evidence of crackles on the right hemithorax. Blood tests revealed normocytic normochromic anaemia (Haemoglobin 9.3g/dL, VGM 80fL, CHGM 30mg/dL) and elevated inflammatory parameters (leucocyte count 14720/uL, Neutrophil count 89.4%, C-reactive protein (CRP) 30mg/dL (<0.50), ESR 27mm/h (<20mm/h), being the remaining exams (including liver and renal tests) unremarkable. Screening for HIV, hepatitis B and C were negative. The X-ray showed an opacity on the right lung (Fig. 1) and he was diagnosed with a right upper pneumonia. Blood cultures were collected and he started empiric antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and azythromicin. For a better lung characterization, he was submitted to a thoracic CT that was in keeping with an extensive right pneumonia (Fig. 1).
During the hospitalization, and because there was a poor response to amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid and azythromicin, we switched antibiotic therapy to ceftriaxone. There was a Streptococcus gallolyticus isolated after, in two blood cultures.
Given the unusual microorganism isolated and the consumptive complaints leading to anaemia, he was submitted to an endoscopic study. The upper gastrointestinal exam revealed a chronic gastritis and the colonoscopy showed a colonic polyp <5mm.
Considering that the patient had a prosthetic aortic valve and bacteraemia, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed during hospitalization, revealing a normal functioning aortic mechanical valve, with no other relevant findings.
In view of the exuberant pneumonia and to rule out lung cancer or other complication, he underwent bronchofibroscopy, which was normal.
He completed 14 days of ceftriaxone and was discharged asymptomatic, with negative control blood cultures and negative inflammatory parameters.
One month later, he returned to the ER, presenting with fever (38ºC) and dry cough again. The physical examination was normal except for crackles on the right lung. Cardiac auscultation didnt have murmurs. Blood tests revealed normal leucocyte count 9620/uL, but elevated CRP (12.5 mg/dL (<0.50)), being the remaining exams normal. The X-ray showed an opacity on the right upper and middle lobes. The blood cultures were again positive for Streptococcus gallolyticus (penicillin MIC: 0.047mg/L).
At this point, considering the recurrent pneumonia, as well as the isolated agent (not typical for pneumonia), we highly suspected of infectious endocarditis. He started benzathine penicillin and was submitted to a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) that showed a pulmonary valve vegetation (18x11mm), with a normal aortic prosthetic valve (Fig. 2). The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary team with Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery and the patient was proposed to conservative treatment. We added 2 weeks of gentamicin to the treatment.
During the time he was admitted to the hospital, there were not right heart failure signs. Vital signs remained normal and there was an improvement in his blood inflammatory parameters (leucocyte count 5150/uL, CRP 0.6mg/dL (<0.50), although worsening renal function (creatinine 1.20mg/dL). He completed 6 weeks of benzathine penicillin and 2 weeks of gentamicin. There was clinical and analytics improvement and he repeated a TTE at the third week of treatment showing a pulmonic valve vegetation with similar dimensions (18x7mm). The heart team considered the hypothesis of conservative approach as the best option taking into account surgery risk/benefit, due to the absence of significant valve dysfunction. He was considered cured after the 6 weeks of treatment and discharged asymptomatic, with negative blood cultures.
Three months later he returned with the same complaints. The TTE showed a bigger vegetation (22x12mm), leading to moderate pulmonary valve insufficiency. The case was further discussed in heart team. He was treated with 3 weeks of benzathine penicillin and 2 weeks of gentamicin, at the end of which he was submitted to a successful pulmonic valve replacement surgery.
The post-surgical valve culture isolated a Staphylococcus epidermidis vancomycin-sensitive, for whom the patient completed 6 weeks of additional directed-antibiotic. During this period, he went through physical and respiratory rehabilitation, with slight improvement in his tiredness but no signs of right or left heart failure. He repeated TTE, showing a normal functioning pulmonary prosthetic valve. At discharge, he was asymptomatic, had normal vital signs and analysis (leucocyte count 4540/uL, CRP 0.4mg/dL and creatinine 1.29mg/dL).

"CASE DESCRIPTION
An 83-year-old black woman, born in Angola, without history of asthma, presented to the emergence department with progressive dyspnea, dry cough, asthenia and night sweats associated with respiratory failure, peripheral eosinophilia (27.9%, 9.01x10^9 eosinophils/L) and bilateral peripheral infiltrates of both lungs on chest x-ray. Thoracic Computed tomography (CT) revealed peripheral ground-glass opacities of lung parenchyma. (Fig. 1) Viral serology and baciloscopy on direct sputum examination did not isolate any organism.
Bronchofibroscopy shown no endobronchial alterations and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid revealed eosinophilic alveolitis (total cell count of 280 / mm3, with 45% eosinophils and a CD4 / CD8 ratio of 1:1). Direct mycobacteriological examination, culture and search for pneumocystis were negative. Cytology and Immunophenotyping study documented intense eosinophilia, without evidence of neoplastic cells. Parasitological examination of stool was negative. IgE levels were elevated (17200 ng/ml) and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were normal. Peripheral blood (PB) smear revealed eosinophilia (27.9%, 9.01x10^9), activated lymphocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils with Döhle bodies, and flow cytometry immunophenotyping (IF) analysis of PB revealed eosinophils with markers of maturity, without clonal surface markers.Immunohistochemical analysis for BCR-ABL and alpha and beta-Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) were negative.
The immunological study (including Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, Antinuclear antibody, complement, rheumatoid factor, anti-double stranded DNA) was unremarkable and serologic test for infections (including specific IgG for Aspergillus) were negative. Echocardiogram and pelvic echography did not reveal alterations. Respiratory function tests revealed a restrictive pattern. Although the patient has returned from Angola 20 years ago, serologic testing and empirical preventive treatment for strongyloidiasis (ivermectin 200 mcg/kg daily for two days, repeated at two weeks) was done while test results were pending. The serological result was negative.
The patient was diagnosed with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (PEC), started corticosteroid therapy (CT) (pulses of methylprednisolone, followed by prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day) with clinical and radiological response.The patient was treated with prednisolone (15-25mg) for one year, and when the dose was reduced, she clinically relapsed with two severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization. One year after starting CT, she complained of erythematous-violaceus non-ulcerated non-painful nodular lesions with < 1 cm, on right hand and arm. (Fig. 2)
The biopsy revealed proliferation of vessels and spindle cells with cytological and immunohistochemical atypia consistent with kaposi sarcoma with diffuse expression of Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). (Fig. 3 and 4)
No mucous lesion or palpable lymph nodes were noted, and hemorrhagic, gastrointestinal or pulmonary complaints were not reported. Thoracic-abdominopelvic CT was requested and did not show relevant alterations for the clinical context. Blood count, renal and hepatic function were normal. Fecal occult blood test was negative.
A new IF analysis and quantification of specific immunoglobulin classes, as well as a serological study including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C, was performed and excluded infection and immunodeficiency specific disorders. Tryptase and Beta-2-mycroglobuline levels were normal.
Considering the localized disease with a low impact on the patient´s quality of life, systemic treatment was not required at that time, and she was oriented to Dermatology for local treatment. The patient was discharged with 20 mg of prednisolone as she did not tolerate further CT tapering but the possibility of skin or visceral progression is being continuously monitored. Regarding her clinical and functional phenotype, Omalizumab is being considered as an alternative therapy.
DISCUSSION"
"Case Description:
A 34-year-old caucasian female, with no significant medical or surgical history (including no prior SARS-CoV2 infection or immunization), nor daily medication, was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of fatigue for mild efforts and spontaneous hematomas with one week evolution. She also reported a self-limited episode of diarrhea and difficult-to-treat headache 15 days before. Besides scattered non-traumatic hematomas, she noticed a heavier menstrual flow than usual denying other sources of blood loss, namely epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hematuria or gastrointestinal losses. Gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms, fever or other neurological complaints were denied by the patient. On physical examination, she presented pale skin, small bruises in the upper limbs, with no purpura or petechiae; vital signs were within normal range (blood pressure 127/70mmHg, heart rate 77/min, afebrile). Neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory examination were unremarkable. Full blood count revealed hemoglobin of 6.7g/dL (normal range (NR) 11.5-16.5 g/dL), MCV of 98.3fL (NR 76.0 - 96.0fL), with marked reticulocytosis (16.80%, NR 0.50-2.00%), platelets count of 8x109/L (NR 150-500x109/L) and normal white blood cell count. Peripheral blood smear showed marked thrombocytopenia and policromasia with few schistocytes (Fig. 1). Further investigations revealed normal prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastins time and fibrinogen, INR of 1.0 (NR 0.8-1.1) D-dimer 2675ng/mL (NR <500ng/mL), lactate dehydrogenase of 909U/L (NR 120-246U/L), total bilirubin 2.05mg/dL (NR 0.30-1.20mg/dL) with indirect bilirubin of 1.46mg/dL (NR 0.10-1.00mg/dL), renal function with creatinine of 0.90mg/dL (NR 0.50-1.10mg/dL) and blood urea slightly increased (55.7mg/dL, NR 19-51mg/dL). Haptoglobin was decreased, direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and urinary hemosiderine were negative. The patient underwent a transfusion of one unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and one unit of packed red blood cells (with partial hemoglobin recovery (9.0g/dL)), with maintained clinical stability. Considering clinical presentation (fatigue, hematomas, and menstrual losses) and lab results (DAT-negative hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and schistocytes in PBS) the diagnosis of TTP was hypothesized. We then applied Plasmic score for TTP which was consistent with an intermediate risk (score 5) of having TTP and performed ADAMTS13 assay study in order to confirm our suspicion. The patient immediately initiated PEX plus prednisolone 1mg/kg/day. Meanwhile, HIV/HCV/HBV serologies, PCR SARS-CoV2 test and autoimmunity study were negative, abdominal ultrasound and head computed tomography found no relevant alterations and we were informed that pre-exchange ADAMTS13 activity was 0% (NR 40-140%) and ADAMTS 13 antibody of 95U/mL (NR <15U/mL), confirming the diagnosis of idiopathic acquired TTP.
After 13 sessions of PEX associated with corticotherapy, hemoglobin and platelet count progressively returned to normal (Fig. 2). At the time of discharge, the patient had complete recovery of symptoms and normalization of platelets count and hemoglobin level (hemoglobin 12.1g/dL, platelets 189 x109/L, ADAMTS13 activity was 103%). Prednisolone was gradually tapered down. After three months, the patient kept a favorable evolution without recurrence of symptoms, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

"Case Report
This case concerns an 82-year-old man, previously independent in activities of daily living, with known history of arterial hypertension and dyslipidaemia, treated with the combination of olmesartan 20mg with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg for 5 years, diltiazem 200mg and pravastatine 40mg.
He was admitted to the emergency department after syncope, without head trauma. He reported a history of diarrhea, with 2 or 3 loose bowel movements per day for the previous 2 months, without blood, mucous or pus. Additionally, he mentioned progressive fatigue and non-quantified weight-loss. There was no history of fever, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. He was medicated with Saccharomyces boulardii and cefixime, with no improvement.
Physical examination showed signs of dehydration with no other remarkable findings. Laboratory results revealed severe hypokalemia (K 1.82 mmol/L), mild hypomagnesemia (Mg 1.5 mg/dL) and acute renal failure (serum creatinine 2.35 mg/dL and urea 130 mg/dL), with normal values of other blood minerals, complete blood count and C-reactive protein. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm without changes justifying the syncope. He had an outpatient colonoscopy with no macroscopic abnormalities of colonic mucosa, but biopsies were not done.
The diagnosis of severe dehydration (with acute renal failure and severe hypokalemia) leading to syncope was admitted, caused by chronic diarrhea, etiology to be determined.
Clostridium difficile toxin, parasitological and cultural stool tests for Campylobacter, Salmonella and Shigella were negative. Thyroid function was normal and human immunodeficiency virus serology was negative. He presented hypoalbuminemia of 2.80 g/dL, folic acid of 5.68 ng/mL and vitamin B12 of 182 ng/mL. Both IgA and IgG anti-transglutaminase antibodies were negative.
There were no macroscopic findings at upper endoscopy, but duodenal biopsies revealed lymphoplasmocytic inflammatory infiltration in the lamina propria with some eosinophils, villous atrophy and increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (Figures 1 and 2). No microorganisms were found.
The patient´s condition promptly improved with fluid and electrolyte replacement. Five days after admission, diarrhea stopped and renal function and kalemia normalized. In addition to hydrochlorothiazide and diltiazem, lisinopril 20mg was started, with blood pressure control and no side effects reported.
Towards a complete symptoms resolution 5 days after antihypertensive drugs withdrawal, with serologic exclusion of coeliac disease, an olmesartan-induced enteropathy was admitted. However, after symptom resolution and histologic confirmation of enteropathy, when applying the adverse drug reaction (ADR) score [2], we obtained 3 points, which means that there is only a possible association between olmesartan and diarrhea.
One year after olmesartan withdrawal, the patient remains asymptomatic, without new episodes of diarrhea.

"Case presentation
A 54-year-old woman with background of depression and arterial hypertension was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) for progressive gait and sensitivity disturbances developing throughout almost a year.
In the Emergency Department, the neurological exam shown peripheral paraesthesia, abolishment of profound sensitivity in the upper and lower limbs, ataxic gait with need for bilateral support, dysmetria in the finger-to-nose test and positive Romberg test. It was decided to admit the patient on the Medical Ward for aetiological investigation.
Spinal MRI showed linear hyperintense T2 signal centromedular along the dorsal segment, with cervical extension, predominantly in the posterior cord with no apparent enhancement after contrast.(Fig.1)
Lumbar puncture revealed acellular liquor without significant glucose consumption (40%) and mildly elevated proteins (58mg/dL). No oligoclonal bands were detected.
An exhaustive screening for infectious (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C viruses [HCV], syphilis and Borrelia serology), autoimmune (antinuclear, extractable nuclear antigen and double stranded desoxyribonucleic acid antibodies), metabolic (seric copper, ceruloplasmin, folate, vitamin B12, homocysteine, methylmalonic acid and thyroid function) or neoplastic causes (thoracic, abdominal and pelvic Computed Tomography scan) was done, and the only relevant results were a low folate level (1,1 ng/mL), an equivocal B.burgdoferi IgG with positive IgM serology by ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and abnormal evoked potentials.
It was assumed a combination between folate deficiency and a demyelinating disease (mildly elevated liquor proteins, sensory ataxia, MRI pattern and abnormal evoked potentials, suggested multiple sclerosis). A 5-day cycle of pulsed corticotherapy and folate supplementation was tried with no symptomatic improvement.
Given the unsuccessful treatment it was decided to restart the investigation searching for other aetiology. Reviewing the background story, even though the patient never detected any tick-bite stigma, she worked in a school surrounded by tall grass and was her habit to cross it when exiting her workplace. So, it was decided to repeat the serology, this time by the Western Blotting test, which was positive for B.burgdoferi IgG.
Lumbar puncture was repeated and positive IgG B.burgdoferi was detected, with the same method, supporting the diagnosis of LNB.
A regimen of 30 days of ceftriaxone was done with minor improvement and patient was discharged for outpatient follow-up with regular physical rehabilitation (at discharge patient had total incapacity to walk).

During the first six month follow-up there was a frank amelioration in the gait and paresthesia. After one-year all the spinal MRI abnormalities had disappeared and now, almost three years after hospital admission the patient is able to walk autonomously with the help of a single crutch.

"CASE PRESENTATION
In December 2012, a hypertensive and dyslipidaemic 65-year-old woman with hepatic steatosis, chronically medicated with olmesartan 20 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, indapamide 2,5 mg and sinvastatine 20 mg, presented with watery diarrhoea without blood or mucous, abdominal pain and early post-prandial vomiting, for 3 weeks, causing weight loss of 5 kg since the beginning of symptoms, and acute renal failure with hypokalaemia. She denied recent travels, sick contacts, and recent changes in diet or medication.
The patient was hospitalized and hydration and empiric antibiotherapy with cotrimoxazol was instituted, with presumed diagnosis of an infective gastroenteritis. She presented favourable outcome, although coprocultures resulted negative.
The patient was re-hospitalized in January 2013, due to recurrence of the symptoms. An extensive investigation was preformed revealing the following results:
- Normal thyroid function tests.
- Negative HIV serology.
- Negative Clostridium difficile toxin assays; no ova, cyst and parasites on stool.
- Negative IgA endomysial, IgA tissue transglutaminase, IgA and IgG gliadine antibodies.
- The upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy (Figure 1) showed haemorrhagic gastropathy, an antral polypus and a duodenal ulcer. The gastric mucosa biopsy revealed various high activity chronic gastritis lesions, and reactive faveolar hyperplasia (Figure 2). Negative to Helicobacter pylori.
- Normal colonoscopy.
- No lesions on the abdominal CT with gastrographine.
- Upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy with DII segment biopsies (Figure 3) revealed moderate chronic duodenitis with morphologic aspects compatible with celiac disease/celiac-like enteropathy.
- Negative therapeutic prove with colestiramine.
- Negative gastrinemia assay.
The patient gradually recovered with hydration, and a gluten-free diet.
Ten days after discharge the patient was again hospitalized due to recurrence of symptoms (watery diarrhoea, vomiting), dehydration, and acute renal failure with severe metabolic acidosis. The patient recovered with intensive hydration and empiric antibiotherapy with metronidazole. Additional clinical investigation consisted of a second colonoscopy which revealed mild chronic colitis (Figure 4).
The patient recovered normal renal function, presenting significant improvement of symptoms, maintaining semi-liquid dejections in lower frequency. Olmesartan associated sprue-like enteropathy was suspected so, on discharge, the anti-hypertensive drug was changed to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The patient was recommended to maintain a gluten-free diet.
At the 1-month follow-up evaluation, the patient reported complete recovery of symptoms. On the 7-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic, had gained weight and was not complying with the diet. The duodenal biopsies showed recovery of normal villous architecture (Figure 5).
DISCUSSION"
"Case report
The authors report a 57-year old Caucasian male clinical case, diagnosed with IgG4-related disease four months before admission. The diagnosis was based on retroperitoneal fibrosis, ground glass pulmonary areas, increased inflammatory parameters as well as two histology results compatible with IgG4-related disease (lymph node excision and pulmonary biopsy). He started prednisolone 1mg/kg/day for eight weeks with progressive tapering down (30 mg/day at the admission time). His medical background also included type 2 diabetes mellitus (treated with insulin and gliflozin association), hypertension (non-pharmacological control) and dyslipidaemia (statin). He was alcohol abstinent but used to drink 50 g/day until nine months before admission. Living in a rural environment was the only epidemiologic factor identified. Never left his native country (Portugal).
The patient was admitted to the emergency room with one week evolution of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, anorexia and constipation. On physical examination he had confused speech (Glasgow coma scale 14) and was pale, sweating excessively, hypothermic, tachypneic and tachycardic with normotension. The abdominal examination demonstrated diffuse moderate pain without peritoneal irritation signs. Lab results revealed serious metabolic acidemia (pH 6.99, HCO3- <3 mmol/L, pO2 144 mmHg, pCO2 9 mmHg, lactate 1.7 mmol/L), hyperglycaemia (414 mg/dL maximum), elevated inflammatory parameters (30.100 X 109/L white blood cells with 85% neutrophilia but without eosinophilia; C-reactive protein 159 mg/L), mild hyponatremia (sodium 132 mmol/L), serum creatinine 1.3 mg/dL and lactate dehydrogenase elevation (1224 U/L maximum). The abdominopelvic Computed Tomography (CT) identified diffuse colonic parietal thickening, more evident in the right hemicolon, suggesting a colitis phenomenon and excluding other aetiology and complications. Blood cultures were taken. Empiric broad spectrum antibiotic has been initiated (piperaciline/tazobactam), as well as volemic reposition, insulin and potassium supplementation.
Nevertheless, he developed cutaneous abdominal vasculitic-like lesions and septic shock. The multiorgan dysfunction included: cardiocirculatory (norepinephrine maximum 0.35 ug/kg/min); respiratory (hemoptoic sputum and progressive worsening ratio - minimum PaO2/FiO2 = 115 and invasive mechanical ventilation need); hematologic (normocytic/normochromic anaemia and mild thrombocytopenia, performing two erythrocyte concentrate transfusion) and neurologic dysfunction (obtundation). Bloodstream cultures were positive to Escherichia coli and gastrointestinal tract origin assumed. Strongyloides stercoralis larvae were observed by microscope on sputum samples (see fig. 1). Severe hyperinfection by Strongyloides stercoralis became evident. Enteric albendazole was initiated (400 mg twice/day for four days) and ivermectin (15 mg/day) was associated two days later. Despite treatment, the patient´s clinical deteriorated and died two days later (UCI admission gravity scores SAPS II 18, APACHE II 18).

"Case description
We present a case of an 80-year-old woman, who had history of essential hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 1 obesity and was chronically medicated with pantoprazole 20mg, acetylsalicylic acid 100mg, lisinopril 5mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg and simvastatin 40mg.
She presented at the emergency department with progressive heart failure starting two weeks prior to admission, characterized by breathlessness, palpitations, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, dyspnea at rest, weight gain, orthopnea, oedema of lower limbs. She denied fever (above 38ºC), sweating and weight loss. She denied any previous heart disease.
On her physical examination she was tachycardic, but rhythmic with muffled heart sounds and fine pulmonary crackles on auscultation. She also presented with signs of fluid overload such as peripheral oedema and hepatojugular reflux. No adenomegaly were found.
The blood analysis showed dilutional anemia and normal LDH (unlike effusions LDH) (Table 1 and 2). Sinus tachycardia (130 beats per minute) and low voltage QRS complexes were found on her electrocardiogram. She also performed a 24-hour HOLTER exam which revealed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed large pericardial effusion (anterior axis 29mm, posterior 23mm) with deposits of fibrin/secondary deposits (Figure 1). Diagnostic and therapeutic pericardiocentesis was performed, and its analysis was compatible with an exudate as it showed increased LDH (Table 2). Cytology analysis had Pericardial fluid with abundance of atypic lymphocytes, with large and polymorph nuclei. Immunohistochemical analysis was positive for CD20 and negative for CD3 and CD5, compatible with non-hodgkin B cell lymphoma.
Bone marrow biopsy showed no medullary involvement and the body Positive Emission Tomography reported only pathological findings in the pericardium (PET-CT): Perithoracic-aorta, Infundibulum and Apex (Figure 2), thus extracardiac disease was excluded.
After the final diagnosis was established the patients, clinical case was submitted to a multidisciplinary meeting. The possibility of performing a tissue biopsy (myocardium/pericardium) was discussed but was dismissed as it would not interfere with the therapeutic plan or and would have unnecessary risks. Thus, the diagnosis of Primary Cardiac B Cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma was made and the patient started on chemotherapy. R-CHOP was started (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) and remission was achieved after the first chemotherapy cycle. The patient has been in remission for 5 years with maintenance therapy (rituximab) with no recurrence of pericardiac effusion, other cardiac signs or symptoms or PET-CT lymphoma associated lesions.

"Case Description
A 63-year-old female was referred to an Internal Medicine consultation for possible autoimmune disease. She had a 3-month history of extremally painful digital ulcers, beginning in winter, complicating a RF that started 2 years before. Previous Vascular Surgery consultation had ruled out thromboangiitis obliterans (Buergers disease) after extensive study. There was no clinical improvement with smoking cessation. RF was biphasic and symmetrical to both hands and feet. The patient also referred involuntary weight loss and fatigue. She reported no other symptoms.
The patient had a past medical history of hypertension and depression under treatment with losartan 50 mg q.b., clomipramine 25 mg q.b., and aspirin 100 mg q.b..
Physical examination revealed severe ulceration of the distal phalanx of the second right finger with bone exposure (figure 1) and small punctate necrosis of the distal phalanx of the third right and left fingers (figure 2  left finger). None of the ulcerations were infected but all were extremely painful. The remaining clinical observation was unremarkable.
Laboratory results showed a rheumatoid factor of 27 UI/mL (reference range < 20 UI/mL) and the presence of cryoglobulins compatible with cryoglobulinemia type II: 0.9 mg/dL of polyclonal IgG and 4.5 mg/dL of monoclonal IgM. Nailfold capillaroscopy revealed giant capillaries, capillary hemorrhages, and mild disorganization of the capillary architecture (figure 3).
Complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry (including complement C3 and C4), urinalysis and thyroid hormonal studies were normal. Clinical relevant serologies were negative namely HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 (HIV 1 and 2) and Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA). Serologic tests for autoantibodies were negative including anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies (anti-Sjögrens syndrome related antigen A and B), ANA (anti-nuclear antibody), ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), APS (antiphospholipid syndrome antibodies) and ACPA (anti-citrullinated protein antibodies). No suspicious lesions were identified in computed tomography of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis as well as in the PET-scan (positron emission tomography). Bone marrow biopsy revealed no abnormalities.
No life-threatening organ damage and no associated etiology was found. Essential type II cryoglobulinemia was assumed and symptomatic treatment was directed to the RF and pain relief. Amlodipine 10 mg, pentoxifylline 400 mg, naproxen 250 mg where started, as well as cold temperature avoidance, use of gloves and skin hydration. After 2 months, the small digital ulcers had healed and the largest one cured after 6 months (figures 4 and 5) with no recurrence after 1 year. Serologies were repeated and remained negative.

"CASE DESCRIPTION
A 35-year-old portuguese man with a medical history of cavernous angiom, focal epilepsy and hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis, presented to our emergency department (ED) with a 5-month history of intermittent nausea, vomiting, anorexia, repeated episodes of diffuse abdominal pain, marked fatigue and recurrent holocraneal headaches. He reported a history of weight loss in the last 8 months (about 16 Kgs). His mother referred that over the past few months he had experienced several periods of transient confusion with impairment of consciousness levels/obnubilation during which hypoglycemia was detected (lower capillary blood glucose of 44 mg/dL). The patient had sought medical services four times since the onset of symptoms. A review of the records revealed that he had low blood pressure, transient acute kidney injury and persistent normocytic anemia, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. A fecal occult blood test was negative and he had also performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and a cranial, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography that were normal except for the cavernous angiom already known. He was treated for a depressive disorder and his psychiatric medication was adjusted six days before he went to our ED because he felt unable to do anything, stating that he didnt have the strength to eat or to do his hygiene. He denied fever, diarrhea, jaundice, heartburn, visible blood loss, head injury, visual disturbances, syncope, precordial pain, respiratory or urinary complaints, past history of tuberculosis, alcohol, tobacco or illicit drug use. He was taking levothyroxine, levetiracetam, pantoprazol, clomipramine, mirtazapine, risperidone and amisulpride.
On admission the patient was conscious but with verbal response lentification and a disorganized speech, afebrile, normotensive (120/83 mmHg) and his pulse was 73 bpm. He was 67 Kg in weight and 184 cm in height with a body mass index of 19.79 Kg/m2 and exhibited generalized hyperpigmentation since the previous year. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
To assess his symptoms initial evaluation included a complete blood count and biochemical profile (Table 1). Electrocardiography and chest radiograph were normal. A cranial computed tomography was ordered with no new findings.
In view of his symptoms, darker complexion, normocytic anemia, hypotonic hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, history of hypoglycemia and low blood pressure records he was admitted to a medical ward considering the diagnostic hypothesis of PAI.
Additional laboratory investigations (Table 2) were performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of PAI.
The recent abdominal computed tomography showed no calcification, enlargement or surrounding mass lesion in the adrenal glands. He was negative for HIV testing and 17-OH-progesterone was normal. Autoantibodies against 21-hydroxilase and plasma very long chain fatty acids were performed, but results are not yet available. However, in this case, because of his history of autoimmune thyroid disease and its known association with other autoimmune endocrine disorders, autoimmune adrenalitis would be the most likely cause of PAI. Other autoimmune disorders were excluded. After discussion of the case with Endocrinology, the patient was started on hydrocortisone 100mg intravenous every 8 hours and due to clinical and electrolyte improvement, the next day hydrocortisone was weaned to oral dose of 20 mg in the morning, 10 mg at lunch and 10 mg in the evening. He also started fludrocortisone replacement therapy with 0.1 mg in the morning. His clinical status greatly improved and was discharged under oral hydrocortisone 10 mg-5 mg-5 mg per day. On follow-up at 25 days he was tapering off psychiatric medication, showing significant improvement. The patient had gained weight, pigmentation had reduced and his blood pressure, electrolytes, haemoglobin value and blood sugar were within normal limits. He was educated about the importance of maintaining lifelong hormone therapy with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids and how to administer intramuscular hydrocortisone in case of emergency.

DISCUSSION"
"Case Report
A 56-year-old male, smoker and without other relevant health history, was admitted to hospital with left anterior chest pain, preceded on the previous week, by fever, myalgia, and fatigue. On admission, physical examination was unremarkable and laboratory testing revealed elevation of acute-phase reactants - c-reactive protein (CPR) 23 mg/dL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 80 mm/s. On the same day, chest x-ray and CT scan showed interstitial lung fibrosis, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pericardial effusion, the latter confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (22 mm, without cardiac tamponade) (Figure 1). He was started on empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. On the next two days, hemodynamic instability and atrial fibrillation developed; pericardiocentesis (380 cc) and electric cardioversion were performed. Pericardial fluid analysis showed an exudate with polimorphonuclear (30%) and mononuclear (70%) cells, microbial studies were negative (Adenosine deaminase, Acid-fast bacilli, culture and viruses). Hemodynamic instability persisted and respiratory failure established, requiring intensive care unit transferral, vasopressor support (noradrenaline) and mechanical ventilation. Transthoracic echocardiography was repeated and showed right ventricular systolic dysfunction (S 9 cm/s), moderated mitral ant tricuspid insufficiency with pulmonary hypertension (PASP 47 mmHg); hemodynamic measurement with Swan-Ganz catheter was compatible with distributive shock, from a presumed respiratory infection. Antibiotics were escalated to piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin with good response, accomplishing 14 days of antimicrobial treatment.
At discharge, all tests performed - blood cultures, serology (viruses - B and C hepatitis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex 1/2, Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Parvovirus B19; bacterial - Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia sp, Borrelia burgdorferi, Brucella sp) and autoimmunity (ANA, ENA, anti-cardiolipine, lupus anticoagulant, anti-β2 glycoprotein, anti-dsDNA) were negative. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed normal CD4/CD8 cell count and gallium scintigraphy was negative for active Sarcoidosis.
On clinical re-evaluation, one month later, he was asymptomatic without pericardial effusion and lung fibrosis on CT scan. Six weeks later, he appealed again to hospital with fever and chest pain, and it was found a pericardial effusion relapse with pleural effusion (Figure 2).
At this point, with recurrent febrile serositis attacks and all tests performed (infectious and autoimmunity) negative, the diagnostic hypothesis of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was considered, and later confirmed by genetic test (heterozygote mutations Arg408Gln and Pro369Ser). He started Colchicine (1 mg/daily) with good tolerance, no recurrence, and no evidence of proteinuria at three years follow-up.
Discussion"
"Case Description: A 24 year-old male patient of african descent was brought into the Emergency Room complaining of shortness of breath at ever lower effort levels, a cough containing mucoid sputum, and edema of the lower limbs  symptoms that had been steadily worsening over the two previous weeks. More recently, he had also noticed an increase in abdominal volume. The patient denied having a fever, palpitations or dizziness, chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea, or reduced diuresis.Initial assessment revealed that the patient didnt have a fever, was normotensive but tachycardic (HR: 150 bpm); he had no signs of respiratory distress, and showed good peripheral oxygen saturation. Venous jugular turgescence was present even at 90º. Cardiac auscultation confirmed tachycardic and arrythmic heart sounds. Pulmonary auscultation identified diminished breathing sounds in the inferior half of the right chest. Moderate ascites and edema of the lower limbs were also identified.The patients personal history included recently diagnosed Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B Virus coinfection, which was being treated with antiretroviral drugs (Tenofovir/Emtricitabine and Darunavir/Ritonavir) (Table 1). He denied any alcoholic, tobacco or drug abuse, or any known family history of heart disease. In view of the clinical evaluation of the patient and initial laboratory study (Table 2) that revealed a B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) value of 635.7 pg/mL, Inaugural Acute Heart Failure was diagnosed.
Initial electrocardiography (EKG) revealed an Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. As the time of onset was unknown, the heart rate was controlled with digoxin and beta-blockers. Later during the patients stay, a second ECG showed that there had been spontaneous cardioversion to sinus rhythm, but it also revealed a right heart axis deviation and negative T-waves in the precordial V1, V2 and V3 right deviations. A chest x-ray identified a moderate right-sided pleural effusion (Figure 1), with no other significant alterations. A diagnostic thoracocentesis was performed, making it possible to characterize the pleural fluid as an exudate (according to Lights criteria). Further study of the sample was negative for tumoral cells and cultural analysis (including Mycobacterium). Transthoracic Cardiac Ultrasound revealed severe dilation of the right chambers of the heart and right ventricular disfunction with left deviation of the interventricular septum; left chambers of the heart of normal size; slight decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (42%); and free tricuspid valve regurgitation, which made it impossible to estimate the PSAP value although there were indirect signs of severe pulmonary hypertension. Given the patients personal history of HIV infection and the results obtained from the cardiac ultrasound, HIV-associated Pulmonary Hypertension was our main diagnostic hypothesis. Therefore, the patient was transferred to an experienced Pulmonary Hypertension Hospital Centre where right heart catheterization was performed and rejected this diagnosis. To discover the aetiology of the HF, the patient underwent a cardiac MRI which produced findings compatible with a major criterion for the diagnosis of Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC): Global hypokinesia of the free wall of the right ventricle, with an area of dyskinesia in the inferior basal region. Severe decrease in the systolic function of the right ventricle (23%). In view of these results, we concluded that the patient had a false pulmonary hypertension and according to the ARVC diagnostic criteria published by the International Task Force Criteria for the Diagnosis of Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy, this patient displays two Major Criteria2 (Global or regional dysfunction and structural alteration on MRI and Repolarization abnormalities on ECG) allowing a definitive diagnosis of ARVC.
Conclusion: While ischaemic heart disease, valve disease and hypertension are predominant causes of HF among older patients, the causes of HF in the young adult are more varied. In this age group, congenital heart and inherited heart diseases and cardiomyopathies should be considered as possible causes.1
In this case HIV infection is also an important factor to consider as it is an established risk factor for pulmonary hypertension and as this disease progresses with right ventricular involvement, patients may report symptoms of heart failure. The diagnosis of HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension is one of exclusion, and secondary causes should be ruled out. Right heart catheterization is the gold standard diagnostic test for pulmonary hypertension, which is defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 25 mmHg at rest in the setting of a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. 3
ARVC is an inherited heart-muscle disorder that predominantly affects the right ventricle, in which the progressive replacement of the myocardium by fibrofatty tissue is the hallmark of the disease.4 The prevalence of ARVC is estimated to affect 1 in 5.000 of the population, and it typically appears in 10-30 year-old individuals,4 usually with symptoms such as palpitations or effort-induced syncope. However, the majority of patients are asymptomatic, and the disease is suspected by electrocardiographic and cardiac ultrasound alterations or by the identification of ventricular arrythmias.5 This cardiomyopathy is frequently underdiagnosed.5
Treatment and management of ARCV begins with risk stratification, as natural history of the disease is related to ventricular electric instability, arrhythmias, and sudden death especially in young adults. A definite risk algorithm has not been established; however risk stratification includes inquiring for the presence of symptoms of heart failure, syncope, history of malignant arrhythmic events and the existence of right ventricle dilation or dysfunction, left ventricle or both in heart ultrasound or cardiac magnetic resonance.6
In our case, our patient will undergo a lifelong clinical follow-up to periodically evaluate worsening of symptoms or progression of morphological or functional ventricular abnormalities or arrhythmias. A therapeutic plan was built for our patient, including lifestyle changes and pharmacological treatment (b-blockers and heart failure therapy). Further study is being planned in order to assess the need for ICD implantation.

"Case Report
A 74-year-old man, previously independent, presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomits, diarrhea, prostration and episodic confusion. At admission, the patient was disoriented and unable to provide clinical information. A friend revealed that the gastrointestinal symptoms had started that day but the disorientation episodes had begun a few days earlier. There was no reported fever.
The patient had a past medical history of hypertension (usual blood pressure (BP) level of 220/120 mmHg), with poor therapeutic adherence as he did not take any medications despite of medical prescriptions of lisinopril and amlodipine. He was a former smoker and had a history of alcohol abuse, Madelung disease, bilateral Dupuytren contracture and a prior 15-year-old subdural hematoma after a car accident.
Examination showed an emaciated man with disperse large lipomas on the anterior and posterior cervical regions, anterior pectoral girdle and left shoulder. The liver was soft and smooth, palpable 2 cm below the costal margin. Collateral liver circulation was notorious at the abdominal examination, as well as bilateral Dupuytren contracture. There was no abdominal bruit or peripheral edema. No other important sign was present. During physical examination, the patient presented a tonic-clonic seizure which lasted 30 second and BP dropped to 82/50 mmHg.
Laboratory results showed severe hyponatremia of 116 mmol/L (reference range (RR) 136146 mmol/L), hypokalemia of 2,8 mmol/L (RR 3,5-5,1 mmol/L), creatinine 1,10 mg/dL (RR 0,72-1,18 mg/dL), estimated glomerular filtration rate (Cockroft-Gault equation) of 58,33 mL/min/1,73m2, bicarbonate 27,8 mmol/L (RR 21-29 mmol/L), pH 7,54 (RR 7,35-7,45), serum osmolality 235 mosm/kg (RR 260302 mosm/kg), blood alcohol concentration of 0,00 g/L, c-reactive protein 1,53 (RR <0,5 mg/dL) and leukocytes 16,0 G/L. Head computed tomography (CT) scan only revealed lesions compatible with prior trauma and subdural hematoma drainage.
The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of severe symptomatic hyponatremia and hypertension, starting electrolyte correction immediately. As blood electrolyte correction proceeded, the patient became more oriented, confirming the history of hypertension and referring polyuria as well. No more seizures occurred during the hospital stay and BP climbed to the usual levels so nifedipine 30 mg was started, and secondary hypertension study was performed.
The patientÂ´s renal ultrasound revealed a right kidney length of 6,2 cm and a normal left kidney length, with normal corticomedullary differentiation. The right renal artery was not possible to assess using color Doppler, and it suggested an increased resistance in the left renal artery. Angio-CT scan revealed an atrophic right kidney with stenosis of the entire length of the right renal artery and no abnormalities on the left artery (Fig. 1 and 2).
Accordingly, an extremely increased renin plasma level of 655 uU/mL (RR 7-76) was detected, with no relevant changes in the levels of aldosterone, catecholamine secretion and thyroid hormones. No urine osmolality or electrolyte assessment in a 24-hour urine collection (before electrolyte correction) were obtained, because the patient presented with seizures and treatment with hypertonic fluid was started immediately.
Renal scintigraphy showed a right kidney function of only 2% (Fig. 3). Arteriography was performed, but angioplasty was not possible due to the small right vessel caliber (Fig. 4).
A right laparoscopic total nephrectomy was scheduled, as the hyponatremia and hypokalemia were impossible to be fully corrected without continuous intravenous fluid therapy. After surgery, blood electrolytes and BP normalized, with no need for electrolyte supplements or BP medication.

"Clinical case:
An 84-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of dysphagia to both solids and liquids, fatigue, generalized muscle weakness and girdle-shoulder myalgia with several falls during this period. On the day of admission, she also reported an episode of coffee ground emesis. There was a known history of arterial hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and a recent episode of esophageal candidiasis. Medications included olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, linagliptin, acarbosis, simvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid. She was a non-smoker, who denied other toxic or over the counter medication use. On physical examination she was tachypneic, blood pressure of 70/40 mmHg and heart rate of 100 beats/min with signs of dehydration. Neurological examination revealed a symmetric proximal tetraparesis (Medical Research Council grade 3 to 4/5 of proximal muscles) with myotatic reflexes diminished on upper limbs and abolished on lower limbs. There was no sensory disturbance. Further examination exposed negative Hoffman sign, normal plantar reflexes, no ophthalmoparesis or ptosis, and normal fatigability tests.
Laboratory studies revealed a C-reactive protein elevation (81.9g/L) and acute kidney injury (serum creatinine of 262.61µmol/L and blood urea nitrogen of 14.2mmol/L). Urinary sediment was notable for microscopic hematuria and renal ultrasound was normal. A 3 to 4-fold elevation of serum aminotransferases and creatine kinase(CK) of 499U/L were present. Mild hypercalcemia was also noticed (serum ionized calcium 1.88mmol/L). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia and an elevated lactate of 2.5mmol/L. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.
Assuming upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with hemodynamic instability, fluid resuscitation, supplemental oxygen and intravenous (IV) esomeprazole were begun. Upper GI endoscopy exposed extensive esophageal candidiasis and severe esophagitis whose biopsies were suggestive ofCandidaand CMV infection.
Evaluation of elevated transaminases included normal liver function tests and abdominal ultrasound, exclusion of hepatitis B, C and HIV, and a SPE which uncovered hypogammaglobulinemia with low levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG. CMV viral load on peripheral blood was 4223IU/mL. Besides the esophagus, the muscle and liver were possible manifestations of CMV tissue-invasive disease.
Investigation of acute non-traumatic tetraparesis included brain and cervical spine computed tomography (CT) which excluded recent vascular lesions and spondylotic myelopathy. A lumbar puncture was performed and unveiled a slight elevation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein (0.66g/L) with normal white blood cell count (<5 cells/µL). Due to albuminocytologic dissociation, a 5-day IVIg therapy was started with little improvement of muscle weakness. Electromyogram (EMG) showed myopathic irregularities with no neuromuscular junction compromise, suggesting a diffuse lesion of muscle fibers. A whole-body muscular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed remarkable inflammatory diffuse symmetric myopathy with perifascial edema, affecting mainly the shoulder girdle and the posterior and medial compartment of the lower limbs (Fig. 1). Functional respiratory tests showed low maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures. Further investigation revealed a positive ANA (fine speckled pattern with a titer of 1:640), anti-DFS70, anti-SSA, anti-Ro52, anti-cN1A and anti-AChR antibodies (13.1nmol/L). Notably, myositis-specific antibodies (MSA) were absent. Muscle biopsy was not possible.
Hypercalcemia investigation showed low parathormone (PTH) levels with normal 1.25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and alkaline phosphatase levels. Thyroid function was unremarkable and PTH-related peptide was negative. Partial correction of calcaemia was achieved with vigorous fluid therapy.
Due to suspicion of underlying malignancy, the patient underwent a chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scan uncovering a 1.2-inch anterior mediastinal mass (Fig. 2). A percutaneous core-needle biopsy was inconclusive. Then a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was realized with thymectomy, partial lung excision and partial pleurectomy. Histopathological evaluation showed a thymoma, Masaoka stage IIB and World Health Organization type AB, with pleural invasion (Fig. 3).
During hospitalization, she completed 14-days and 21-days course of fluconazole and valganciclovir, respectively. After multidisciplinary discussion, adjunctive radiotherapy was performed. There was no recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding and dysphagia improved after medical treatment. CMV viral load became undetectable. After surgery, muscle strength rapidly increased, CK levels normalized, and hypercalcaemia resolved.
At one-year follow-up, there was a significant recovery of muscle strength, allowing independent walking and no new symptoms appeared. CK levels were normal besides some myopathic irregularities on EMG. Hypogammaglobulinemia resolved and titers of anti-AChR antibodies decreased.

"Clinical case
83-year old male patient, with type-2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, Parkinson´s disease and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score of 50%, admitted for treatment of sepsis after a urological procedure. At admission, the patient also complained of dry cough with some weeks of duration, without any other cardiopulmonary, general and constitutional symptoms. Physically, the patient appeared unwell, with some loss of muscle mass and pulmonary auscultation revealed inspiratory crackles in the left hemithorax. Vital signs registration showed a slight tachycardia and peripheral oxygen desaturation, which was characterized as type 1 respiratory insufficiency by arterial blood gases measurement. His initial blood workup documented leukocytosis with neutrophilia, C-reactive protein elevation, mild hyponatremia, and his chest X-ray showed diffuse left lung opacities and a mediastinal enlargement (Fig. 1).

Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in blood and urine cultures. The initial interpretation was that the patient was suffering from nosocomial urinary sepsis, with secondary pneumonia due to the Pseudomonas bacteriemia. The patient was treated with fluids and piperacillin-tazobactam, with rapid improvement. Despite this fact, he kept a persistent dry cough and type 1 respiratory insufficiency.
A thoracic CT-scan showed a left antero-lateral lobulated mediastinal mass (68mm), near the left pulmonary artery, with heterogeneous density and extensive calcified, quistic and soft tissue components (Fig. 2), bilateral pulmonary nodules and left pulmonary atelectasis.

The next diagnostic steps were discussed with the patient and his family. A bronchofibroscopy was performed, with aspiration of abundant bronchial secretions and improvement of the atelectasis, there were no signs of any endobronchial masses or external compression and no tissue sample was collected. Next, a transthoracic CT-guided biopsy was carried out, the obtained tissue sample revealed a mediastinal teratocarcinoma with cartilaginous and spinocelular carcinoma components. Beta-hCG levels were elevated and alpha-fetoprotein levels were normal. Testicular evaluation (physical examination and ultrasound) was performed and no masses or nodules were found. At this point, the pulmonary bilateral nodules were interpreted as probable metastases, without any possibility of biopsy due to their location.
The patient was evaluated in the Hospital´s Muldisciplinary Oncological Decision Group and considered unfit for surgery and chemotherapy. Exclusive symptomatic care was decided and a Palliative Care consultation was requested. The patient remained in the ward, developed progressive dyspnoea, cachexia and asthenia and died in the hospital, with all his symptoms well managed and with his family present at the time of death.

"CASE PRESENTATION
A 34-year-old man, without previous medical history, presented in the emergency service with a week lasting non-productive cough and hemoptysis on the day before. He also referred pleuritic pain and gynecomastia of the right breast, for a month. Physical examination showed a supra-nipple swelling in the right breast, in comparison with the left one, and body mass index of 27,3 kg/m.2 He was eupneic, without oxygen therapy, but with mild hypoxemia on arterial blood gases. No testicular masses were palpated and no other changes were detected on physical examination. Blood tests had lactate dehydrogenase elevation (2.8 ULN), with no other abnormalities. The chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary nodules and mediastinal widening (Fig. 1). The patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine ward to further workup.
Legionella, Mycoplasma, Cytomegalovirus, HIV 1 and 2 and viral hepatitis search was negative. Interferon-gamma release assay was positive, but no mycobacteria was found in biological fluids.
The high β-hCG value (12000 ULN) contrasted with other tumor markers, which were normal, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Serum androgen levels were normal. However, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were lower. Significant increases were found concerning estradiol (9 ULN), prolactin (3 ULN) and progesterone (8 ULN).
Testicular and abdominal ultrasound exams were performed, but with no tumor suspicion. Breast ultrasound showed signs of bilateral gynecomastia without other alterations.
A thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) showed a large mass located in the right anterior mediastinum, measuring 93x16x91 mm, extending from the pre-vascular space to the right cardiophrenic angle, presenting areas of liquefaction/necrosis inside. The mass was in contact with the anterior chest wall as well as with the ascending aorta and this mass deforms the superior vena cava and middle lobar vein (Fig. 2). CT also showed several dispersed bilateral pulmonary nodes, leading to suspicion of pulmonary metastasis. Once CT guided biopsy of mediastinal mass was inconclusive, the patient was submitted to thoracotomy and a pulmonary nodule was resected. The patients clinical condition deteriorated, accompanied by an increase in size and number of pulmonary nodules (Fig. 3). Considering the clinical condition and the strong suspicion of GCT, he started chemotherapy (QT) with bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin after written informed consent, and sperm sample collection for cryopreservation, even before histopathological results. Before QT, treatment with isoniazid was initiated, assuming a potential latent tuberculosis. Pathology reported pulmonary metastasis of germinative cell tumor, large cells of syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast type, with strong and diffuse CK7, β-hCG and sall4 expression, indicating choriocarcinoma (Fig. 4). Given the fact that the testicular physical examination and the ultrasound had no alternation, choriocarcinoma of primary mediastinal origin was diagnosed. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the Urology department and after four cycles of QT (4 months) he was clinically stable, with a significant blood β-hCG value reduction (785 ULN)).
Three days after the last QT cycle, he was admitted in the emergency room, due to sudden severe headache associated with nausea and vomits. Head CT showed several brain metastases (Fig. 5). Corticotherapy was initiated (10 mg bolus of iv dexamethasone, followed by 5 mg, 2 times a day, per os) and holocraneal radiotherapy was performed. Despite QT, the disease progressed and the patient returned to the emergency room with similar symptoms, associated with seizure. He did not recover and died on the following day.
DISCUSSION"
"Clinical Case
We report a case of a 59-year-old construction worker with multiple cardiovascular risk factors including former smoking with chronic bronchitis and diabetes mellitus with poor metabolic control. The clinical presentation was a 1-week history of purulent productive cough, malaise and fever, with later development of dyspnea and left pleuritic chest pain. He was admitted in the emergency department with respiratory distress signs, oxygen desaturation (85% on room air) and tachycardia, but with hemodynamic stability. Lung exam findings included diminished breath sounds on the left and rhonchi bilaterally. Examination of the oral cavity revealed dental caries in the molar teeth. Arterial blood gases at room air revealed: pH 7.4, PaO2 50mmHg, ratio PaO2/FiO2 238, PCO2 30 mmHg, HCO3- 18 mmol/L, lactate 5.7 mmol/L. Analytically, an inflammatory syndrome (leucocytosis of 12.9 x 103/uL, 94% neutrophils and a C-reactive protein of 344 mg/L), an acute kidney injury (creatinine of 1.51 mg/dL) and a hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state were documented. Chest radiogram showed an almost entire left hemithorax opacity and urinary pneumococcal antigen was positive. We assumed the diagnosis of sepsis due to pneumococcal CAP (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score: 3). Blood cultures were obtained and intravenous empirical antibiotics were initiated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and azithromycin.
Shortly upon admission, respiratory distress worsened (ratio PaO2/FiO2 121). Patient was sedated, intubated, put on mechanical ventilation and under vasopressor support. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) revealed a NP with entire left lung hepatization with multiple small cavitary lesions coalescing into a larger one in the upper left lobe (Figure 1). No parapneumonic effusion was documented. Blood cultures were positive for pan‑sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. The antimicrobials were switched to intravenous penicillin and clindamycin with a favourable evolution. Patient was extubated on the 8th day but, at 13th hospitalization day, a hospital‑acquired over‑infection with Klebsiella oxytoca (growth in sputum cultures) was observed. Antibiotics were adjusted based on antibiogram, replacing penicillin by ceftriaxone and clindamycin was kept. Bronchoscopy showed no macroscopic changes and the bronchoalveolar lavage cultures were negative.
The patient gradually improved, completing 6 weeks of antibiotics. CT scan was repeated, revealing smaller and less extensive cavitation area but still showing upper left lung lobe consolidation with non‑enhancing contrast areas. At discharge, patient presented with sustained apyrexia and without hypoxemia. Despite the significant imaging changes on CT scan, due to patient clinical recovery with medical treatment alone, surgical devitalized tissue debridement was not required. Patient continued a respiratory kinesiotherapy program. At 6 months, patient reported few respiratory symptoms and functional breathing tests showed moderate obstructive ventilatory disturb. He was treated with inhaled indacaterol and glycopyrronium bromide with good response. He maintains follow-up at Pneumology Consultation.
One year later, CT scan (Figure 2) showed a large cavitary lesion with air content in the left pulmonary apex, thickening of the surrounding pleuropulmonary interface, bronchiectasis and atelectasis extending to the anterior segment. Additionally, an upper left lobe and lingula volumetric reduction with ipsilateral mediastinal shift was observed.

"CASE PRESENTATION
A 70-year-old woman, with history of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and orthopaedic surgery, presented in the emergency room with fever (maximum 38ºC) and anorexia for the past 3 days, unquantified weight loss and night sweats. Physical examination was without major changes. She had already been medicated with antibiotic at the beginning of the symptoms, with no improvement. Complete blood count revealed a normocytic anemia (Hb 8.4 g/dL with MCV of 96.4 fL), leukopenia (1.7x10^9/L) and a mild thrombocytopenia (150x10^9/L). Peripheral blood smear showed 2% of cells with morphological characteristics of immaturity. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, were increased, 45 mm/h and 26.66 mg/dL, respectively. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary nodules (Fig. 1). At chest computed tomography, the pulmonary parenchyma showed multiple confluent peribroncovascular nodular opacities, with para-hilar distribution dispersed throughout pulmonary lobes (Fig. 2). Based on work up findings, pneumonia diagnosis was admitted, and antibiotics were started.
She was admitted to the Internal Medicine ward to further workup. In the first days of hospital stay the patient maintained fever that didn`t give in to antipyretic. All cultures were negative (blood, sputum and urine) and she tested negative to HIV 1 and 2, Legionella, Coxiella, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, parvovirus and interferon-gamma release assay. The folic acid value was in normal range, but vitamin B12 (2xUNL) and ferritin (12xUNL) were above normal range. The electrophoretic proteinogram didnt show relevant alterations as well as immunoglobulins count. Despite undergoing several cycles of antibiotics with piperacillin/tazobactam (7 days), azithromycin (5 days), vancomycin (5 days) and ertapenem (5 days), there was a progressive clinical, analytical, and radiologic worsening. A bronchoscopy was performed and the bronchoalveolar aspirate cytology showed reactive cells with a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells, and the wash cytology was also consistent with the presence of inflammatory cells. No biopsy was performed due to blood dyscrasia and high risk of bleeding associated to SMD and clinical frailty. After improvement of bleeding risk she performed a bone marrow aspirate that revealed the presence of 10.7% of blasts and maturations defects suggestive of MDS with increased type II blasts. There were no phenotype alterations or alterations on FISH technique. The bone marrow biopsy showed infiltration with big cells with blastic nucleus and coarse chromatin, with a left shift in the granulocytic series and diffusely increase in the reticulin (grade 2); it also showed in the immunocytochemical study an increase in the number of blasts, marked with CD34 and CD117, predominantly dispersed, approaching 5-6% of cellularity. These findings were suggestive of MDS with excess blasts.
After excluded infectious diagnosis, it was decided to start empirically corticosteroid therapy with prednisolone 0.75mg/Kg/per day. After several days, a new chest x-ray (Fig. 3) and thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography (Fig. 4) were made and showed an important reduction in number and extension of the densified parenchymal areas when compared to the admission exam, probably of inflammatory nature, suggesting organizing pneumonia. Clinically she showed clear improvement, with sustained apyrexia was well as improvement in inflammatory parameters and pancytopenia.
OP was then admitted in the context of MDS. She was referred to Hematology and Internal Medicine consultation for treatment and follow-up.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The patient is currently followed in Hematology and Internal Medicine consultation. The initial approach to MDS was through a watch and wait strategy with transfusion of red blood cells or platelets when needed. In the present time, she is being treated with azacytidine after transformation for oligoblastic acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), with occasional transfusion need.
The reduction of corticosteroid therapy was accompanied by clinical evaluation and chest X-ray every 3 months to evaluate possible relapse of OP. The patient is currently medicated with 15 mg of prednisolone daily with no alterations in the last chest x-ray she performed.
Despite transformation of the MDS to AML, the patient maintained a good performance status (ECOG 2).
DISCUSSION"
"Case Report
A previously independent 62-year-old woman, was brought to the emergency room due to disorientation and agitation with inappropriate speech after sudden onset of severe headache and fever. There was no history of seizures, loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms. The patient lived on a farm and had a background of smoking, Buerger´s disease, chronic kidney disease, hip prosthesis and hyperuricemia, currently on allopurinol, pentoxifylline, iron, calcitriol and glucosamine.
On admission, the patient was conscious (Glasgow coma scale of 10), but confused, agitated and uncooperative. Physical examination revealed a regular pulse with tachycardia (102 beats/min), normal blood pressure (129/70mmHg) and normal oxygen saturation (96%) on room air. No stiffness of the neck or Brudzinskis sign was evident. No focal neurologic signs were detectable. Auscultation of the chest revealed regular heart sounds, no murmurs and no other abnormalities.
Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, macrocytosis and mild elevation of LDH and CRP. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed collecting a cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), revealling 1963 leukocytes/mm3 (predominantely polymorphonuclear); 10 red cells/mm3; undetectable levels of glucose and 132 mg/dL of protein. Direct examination and Gram staining of CSF were negative. A chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram were performed and they were normal. The patient was hospitalised for the clinical investigation to be carried out. After the blood and CSF culture results, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed by an experienced operator, denying the existence of images suggestive of endocarditis. The colonoscopy revealed melanosis coli (Fig. 1), diverticulosis (Fig. 2) and an adenoma of the rectum (Fig. 3), which was excised. After the cultures of CSF and blood were collected, dexamethasone, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and vancomycin were initiated empirically. On day five, the microbiological results were obtained. Both CSF and blood cultures revealed S. bovis, susceptible to penicillin G and third generation cephalosporin, as a single etiological agent of this infection. At this time, there was a significant clinical improvement. So, we decided to maintain the third generation cephalosporin and stop the other antibiotics. After a 14-day course of antibiotics, the patient remained asymptomatic, afebrile and culture negative after the therapy was stopped. She was discharged with excellent clinical outcome. The histology of the adenoma proved to be a low-grade dysplasia.

"CASE DESCRIPTION
The physical examination revealed digital clubbing and spider nevi telangiectasis. Cyanosis and ascites were not present. The vitals were normal with exception to oxygen saturation level (77% on room air). There was no jugular vein distention or peripheral oedema.
Laboratory analysis showed macrocitosis (haemoglobin 15.3 g/dl (N 13.0-17.0) and mean corpuscular volume 109.7 fl (N 80.0-96.1)); no leucocytosis; platelet count of 71x109/L (N 150-400); normal renal function; altered liver cell integrity markers (aspartate aminotransferase 74 U/L (N<40), alanine transaminase 30 U/L (N < 41) and altered liver function tests (total bilirubin 4.71 mg/dL (N<1.40), direct bilirubin 2.28 mg/dL (N< 0.3), albumin 2.8 g/dl (N 3.5-5.2), prothrombin time 18.4 s (N<14), partial thromboplastin time 34. 5 s (N 23-38)); slightly high C-reactive protein (1.51 mg/dl (<0.50)) and D-dimers of 0.5 μg/Ml (N < 0.3 μg/ml).
At the emergency room (ER), the patient suffered two episodes of haematemesis.
Upper endoscopy was performed and showed small eradicated oesophageal varices, erosive gastritis and Forrest II gastric ulcer 2A/2B, treated with adrenaline injection and clips.
CT-pulmonary angiography performed one day after hospital admission excluded pulmonary embolism but revealed a pneumonia in the left lower lobe. Abdominal ultrasound showed a markedly heterogeneous and micronodular liver (probably due to cirrhosis) and splenomegaly with no ascites.
The patient was started on proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics and was admitted to an Internal Medicine ward. After a 10 day empiric antibiotic regime the patient remained hypoxemic and had persistent dyspnoea with low exercise tolerance and platypnea. Oxygen saturation levels improved in recumbent position; a finding consistent with orthodeoxia. This was confirmed by blood gas analysis (Table 1).
A F99_Technetium macroaggregated albumin lung scintigraphy showed presence of the radiodrug in the kidneys and spleen, a finding compatible with a right to left shunt. Transthoracic contrast echocardiography showed air bubbles in the left heart after 5 cycles, corroborating the existence of an intra-pulmonary right-to-left shunt and therefore making the diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome. (Figure 1)
The patient was discharged on supplemental oxygen with a 31% venturi mask. He was started on garlic tablets - allium sativum (1,8gr/m2 Body Surface Area) and was strongly advised to maintain alcoholic abstinence. The patient is asyntomatic, although no improvement on oxygenation has been achieved thus far.
The patient was referred to a liver transplantation centre and is in the waiting list for an elective liver transplant.
DISCUSSION"
"Clinical case
A 37-year-old caucasian female was referred to our department with refractory osteoporosis. Her significant past medical history included a previous episodes of low back pain with no trauma and a low-trauma Colles fracture in 2010. Imaging assessment performed in 2010 included a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) showing a T-score of -4.1 in the spine and of -2.5 in the femoral neck areas; a magnetic resonance imaging of the dorso-lumbar spine revealing fracture of L1 vertebra and biconvex aspect of L2 vertebra (Figure 1). She was medicated with zolendronic acid during four years, and then with strontium ranelate. Serial DXA measurements performed in 2014 revealed T-score of -4.1 in the spine and of -2.3 in the femoral neck areas. Our patient denied any comorbidity, use of tobacco, alcohol or any medications and illicit drugs. She also had no history of drug allergies and there was no known family history. The patient did not report any constitutional symptoms like weight loss, fever, fatigue, malaise, night sweating or decreased appetite. Her physical examination was unremarkable. The need to exclude secondary causes of osteoporosis led to a broad laboratory assessment which was normal and included complete blood count, C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate; kidney, liver and thyroid function; phosphorus-calcium metabolism with calcium, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone; iron study, homocysteine and celiac disease antibody and also hormonal study including testosterone level, cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Further testing revealed a high serum tryptase level of 22.2μg/L (reference range <11.4) and this guided us to the next step- bone marrow study. The diagnosis of mastocytosis was confirmed by the presence of dense agregates of MC on the bone marrow aspirate (Figure 2 and 3) and MC expressing aberrant CD2 and CD25 on the immunophenotype of bone marrow aspirate. It was not detected KIT D816V mutation. The patient was referred to the department of Hematology and she is currently medicated with calcium and Vitamin D supplements, zolendronate (four mg once every four weeks) and Interferon Alfa (IFN-Alfa) (three million units three times weekly). A new DXA performed in 2018 showed T-score of -3.1 in the spine and of -2.1 in the femoral neck areas.

"Clinical Case:
Male, caucasian, 76 years old, autonomous, with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (under metformin 2 g daily), Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, history of Transient Ischemic Accident in 2015, smoker and mild alcohol comsumption. Admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) after generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizure with reference to sphincter incontinence and few minutes duration. Prior to the crisis, he committed several infractions while driving, stopped answering questions and stopped the car. During transport to hospital, sedation with diazepam 5 mg and midazolam 4 mg was required. In addition, there was an history of diarrhea for the past 6 months. Fever, respiratory complaints or abdominal pain, previous changes in consciousness, epilepsy or similar previous episodes were absent.
In the ED, the patient presented as agitated and non-collaborating, with dysphasia and signs of a bitten tongue, unemarkable cardiac and pulmonary auscultation and cutaneous (pustular) lesions on the inframammary and lateral chest regions. Due to postictal psychomotor agitation, sedation and invasive ventilation were necessary.
The main laboratory findings (Table 1) were normocytic and normochromic anemia, leukocytosis, with 80.3% neutrophils, mild anisocytosis and anisochromic smears, and hypersegmented neutrophils, Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 337 UI/L, Creatinokinase (CK) 208 UI/L, Myoglobin 944 µg/dL. Urinary sediment was unremarkable. Urine test was negative for drugs of abuse. Chest X-ray: no relevant changes. ECG: sinus rhythm, 68 bpm, right branch occlusion. Cranioencephalic computed tomography (CT) showed brain volumetric reduction without lobar distribution. CT scan of the supra-aortic trunk: calcified millimeter atheromatous plaques in the internal carotid artery bulbs and carotid siphons not determining significant stenoses, anatomical variant characterized by hypoplasia of the left vertebral artery with right side dominance and no signs of vertebrobasilar system failure. Lumbar puncture: 3 cells - 3 leukocytes and 0 erythrocytes, glucose 117 mg/dL, proteins 44.8 mg/dL and LDH <30 UI/L.
Considering the clinical worsening, the need for sedoanalgesia and invasive ventilation, he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (IMU) and therapy with Aciclovir 10 mg/kg - 850 mg and Levetiracetam 1g 12/12h was started.
During hospitalization at the IMU, several unsuccessful attempts were carried out to suspend sedation and vasopressor support. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no evidence of epileptiform activity. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) showed discrete hypersignal of the supratentorial periventricular white matter, as well as some hypersignal foci along the subcortical white matter than both cerebral hemispheres, the set translating incipient chronic leukoencephalopathy, at this age more likely due to small vessel disease. Lumbar puncture (48 hours later): 92 cells - 2 leukocytes, 90 erythrocytes, glucose 92, proteins 37.50, LDH <30 UI/L.
Regarding the etiological study (Table 2), vitamin B12 (<83 pg/mL) and iron (iron 21 ug/dL, CTFF 198 ug/dL, transferrin saturation 10%) deficits were identified and intramuscular cyanocobalamin (1 injection per week) and ferrous sulphate 329.7 mg (once a day) were started (Table 2).
On the 6th day of hospitalization, the patient achieved spontaneous ventilation. Bacteriological examination, capsular antigen screening, protein chain reaction (PCR) - varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex 2 virus, cytomegalovirus, epstein barr - virus and VDRL showed negative in the CSF. At this time, acyclovir suspended.
No new episodes of epileptic seizures. Repetition of EEG (without sedation), which remained without epileptiform activity. Due to clinical and hemodynamic stability, the patient was transferred to the Medical Ward.
On admission, he presented with mild psychomotor slowing and broad base gait, with the remaining neurological examination unchanged. During hospitalization, there was clinical improvement, with gradual recovery of amnesia from the event.
Considering the history of diarrhea, the patient underwent upper digestive endoscopy with duodenal biopsy: nodular mucosa, erythematous gastropathy, no evidence of Whipple disease, negative CSF T. whipple PCR, and negative anti-transglutaminase antibodies. Anti-negative parietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor were positive, allowing the diagnosis of with pernicious anemia. Repeated CMRI: overlapping.
Throughout hospitalization, the patient showed signs of clinical improvement; he was conscious, oriented, without evident language deficits, with some faults in evocative memory and ideomotor praxis, without changes in cranial nerves or motor function. At the time of discharge, he was medicated with cyanocobalamin (1 for 3 weeks and then 1 / month), levetiracetam (500 + 1000 mg - for 1 week - and then 500 + 500 mg 12/12 h) and oral ferrous sulfate 12/12 h. Upon reevaluation as an outpatient, there was progressive clinical improvement without further periods of confusion or epileptic seizures.

"Case presentation
We report the case of a 78-year-old female patient with recent diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and a high burden of co-morbidities (moderate aortic stenosis, previous cerebral infarction related right hemiparesis, mild vascular dementia and type 2 diabetes mellitus).
During the follow-up, in outpatient setting,arthralgia and inflammatory markers were very difficult to manage and the pharmacological therapy had to be rapidly escalated to prednisolone 7.5mg qd and methotrexate 17.5mg/week for symptom control. Nonetheless, the inflammatory markers kept high (erythrocyte sedimentation rate >100 mm/h and C- reactive protein 50 mg/dL) which required a new chest-abdomen-pelvis computed tomography scan, to search for uncontrolled systemic disease, which revealed left hydropneumothorax (figure 1.). The patient was immediately called for admission on Medical Ward. At admission she declared to be asymptomatic.
At day 1, the patient underwent thoracentesis which revealed a cloudy yellow pleural fluid with pH 7.05, lactate dehydrogenase > 4000 U/L, glucose consumption (96%) and elevated adenosine deaminase (88.5 U/L). Cytology showed a polymorphonuclear predominant pleural fluid with no apparent malignant cells. Microbiological analysis was negative (including for mycobacteria). It was assumed that the spontaneous hydropneumothorax was related to peripheral lung rheumatoid nodulosis. We decided for conservative approach. Methotrexate was withheld.
At day 7, due to persistence of high inflammatory markers and refractoriness of the hydropneumothorax, it was decided to proceed to pleural drainage and biopsy (to exclude other aetiologies like malignancy and pleural tuberculosis). Later on, the pleural biopsy revealed an inflammatory polymorphic infiltrate with abundant fibrin deposit. No signs of malignancy or mycobacteria growth in culture were shown.
At day 17, after confirmation of hydroneumothorax resolution, the patient was discharged. After multidisciplinary meeting it was decided that, since the inflammatory markers where still high, methotrexate 17.5 mg/week should be reintroduced.
In outpatient setting, the patient was proposed for biological therapy but was rejected because of her co-morbidities and frailty. One month after discharge new asymptomatic left hydropneumothorax was detected in routine chest X-ray (figure 2.) and she was re-admitted for pleural drainage.
Eighteen days later, the pneumothorax chamber was residual and an uneventful chest tube talc slurry pleurodesis was preformed. There was recurrence of the pneumothorax in the next 48h.
Since the chest tube pleurodesis failed, the patient was presented to Cardiothoracic Surgery and proposed for open thoracotomy and decortication. She was rejected due to her comorbidities and frailty. So, after more then 3 months of hospital stay, with a refractory pneumothorax, the patient died due to nosocomial pneumonia.

"CASE REPORT
A 71-year-old hypertensive man presented to the emergency department complaining of nausea, anorexia and vomiting lasting for one month. He reported fever, myalgia, a dry cough and hiccups in the first few days, with spontaneous resolution. On further questioning he also reported dizziness on standing, dry mouth, constipation and a weak urinary stream. On physical examination there was severe symptomatic orthostatic hypotension and a dry oral mucosa with no sublingual pooling of saliva. Aside a slow pupillary response to light, the neurological examination was normal, with no signs of polyneuropathy or atypical parkinsonism. Laboratory studies yielded a normocytic/normochromic anemia with normal levels of iron, vitamins and thyroid hormones and elevation of the C-reactive protein (35mg/L). Further studies established sympathetic and parasympathetic failure: salivary scintigraphy with diffuse hypofunction, gastric scintigraphy with delayed emptying, abdominal computerized tomography (CT) showing diffuse small intestinal distention, Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART) and electrochemical skin conductance measure by Sudoscan revealing reduced sudomotor function (Fig. 1) and abnormal heart-rate response to deep breathing (HRDB) confirming cardiovagal impairment (Fig. 2). Despite several episodes of urinary retention implying urogenital dysfunction, a urodynamic study was not performed due to a nosocomial urinary tract infection. The electromyogram showed no signs of polyneuropathy. A study of conditions associated with dysautonomia, namely a search for paraneoplastic syndromes (toracoabdominopelvic CT, positron emission tomography scan, upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, immunoelectrophoresis of serum and urine, anti-neuron antibodies), rheumatologic diseases (antinuclear antibodies, anti-SS-A and SS-B, rheumatoid factor) and amyloidosis (transthyretin gene sequencing and a search for amyloid in a salivary gland biopsy), was negative.
Testing for anti-AchGR antibodies in serum using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay in a reference laboratory was negative. A diagnosis of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy was established and the patient was treated with IVIG 2g/kg over 5 days every six weeks. Symptomatic treatment was started, with midodrine, fludrocortisone and compression stockings for orthostatic hypotension, pilocarpine drops and artificial saliva for xerostomia, prokinetics, nutritional supplements and a diet reduced in fiber for gastrointestinal hypomotility.
Improvement began after the first infusion, starting with the gastrointestinal symptoms, orthostatic dizziness (despite maintaining orthostatic hypotension) and urinary symptoms. After three months there was no orthostatic hypotension and sicca symptoms started improving. By six months, the patient was asymptomatic, with a normal gastric emptying scintigraphy, improved salivary function on scintigraphy and improved sudomotor function (normal sudoscan  Fig. 3, QSART with reduced sudation restricted to the foot), though HRDB remained abnormal indicating persistent parasympathetic dysfunction; abnormal HRDB persisted after one year of therapy (Fig. 4), and a tilt-test performed at this time was positive in the pharmacological phase of tilting, suggesting sympathetic dysfunction. Tapering of IgIV dose was then started, with a dosage of 1.5g/kg for 9 months, then 1g/kg the next six months, then 0.5g/kg for six months more and finally stopped altogether. After more than a year with no treatment there was no symptom recurrence. Clinical surveillance during this period did not uncover any underlying neoplasm or rheumatological disorder.
DISCUSSION"
"Case Presentation:
A 48-year-old female patient was referenced to the urgent care department, with a necrosis in the third toe of the left foot (Figures 1 and 2) and second and third toes of the right foot (figures 3 and 4). She is an active smoker, with no other relevant personal medical history. About 10 months earlier she had been admitted to another hospital because of inaugural pain and darkening with progressive worsening of 3 toes in the right foot. After etiologic investigation and exclusion of vascular aetiology of atheroembolic nature, RP was admitted and nifedipine was started. When observed in a vascular surgery consultation, the thrombophilic test revealed rheumatoid factor (RF) 99 UI/mL, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) positive (1/160), and positive lupus anticoagulant. It was decided to initiate a low molecular weight heparin, with subsequent symptomatic improvement and scarring of the digital lesions. Four months later, a new relapse of the lesions occurs, with an extension to the third toe of the left foot, with severe and persistent pain. She was hemodynamically stable and peripheral pulses were palpable, ample and symmetric. The patient presented an area of distal necrosis in the second and third toes of the right foot, first and the second toe of the left foot, with the presence of livedo reticularis (Figures 1-4). Further complementary exams revealed leukocytosis (16,7x109/L) with neutrophilia (80%), thrombocytosis (650.000x109/L), with a normal hemoglobin level (13.9 g/dL) and no identifiable alterations on blood smear. The chest radiograph and electrocardiogram were normal. The patient was hospitalized for etiological investigation. The laboratory study was negative for ANA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-smith, anti-ribonucleoprotein, anti-Scl 70, anticentromere, antiphospholipid antibodies, with slightly elevated RF (41 UI/L) and normal complement factor levels. The search for cryoglobulins was negative, protein C and S levels were normal and no activated protein C resistance was shown. Infectious serology was negative for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus. Proteinuria in 24h urine was 224mg. A thoracic-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (TAP-CT) excluded the existence of adenomegalies or any other relevant changes, and the absence of a macrocirculatory dysfunction was confirmed by a Doppler study of the inferior members. A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were performed, which revealed: evidently enlarged and multiple megakaryocytes, with irregular forms and the formation of cellular aggregates. The cytogenetic study was normal but the mutation analysis showed the presence of the JAK2-V617F mutation and the absence of the BCR/ABL translocation, compatible with the ET diagnosis. During hospitalization, there was a global clinical improvement with the introduction of systemic vasodilators, antiaggregation, and analgesia, leading to a greater delimitation of the digital necrotic area and pain control. The patient was discharged with aspirin and smoking cessation. In the first follow-up appointment she manifested a partial symptomatic relief, analytically with persistent thrombocytosis (705x109/L), and for these reasons, it was started hydroxyurea 1g/day. After 2 months of cytoreductive therapy, she had a platelet count of 224x109/L, with substantial improvement of the digital necrotic lesions.

"Case Report
An 85-year-old caucasian man, a former construction worker. He went to the emergency department with a 2-week history of abdominal distension and heartburn. He denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, gastrointestinal blood loss, anorexia, weight loss, fever, asthenia, thoracic pain, and respiratory complaints. He had no recent travels outside Portugal and denied contact with any sick person. He was an ex-smoker (5 pack-year history) and had a 40-year history of alcohol consumption of about 50g/day, without known history of asbestos exposure. Thirteen years before, he had had a surgical resection of a dorsal ependymoma, complicated with paraplegia and no relapse.
On admission, he was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 119/84mmHg and a pulse rate of 70 beats/min. His oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.Abdominal examination revealed ascites without signs of collateral circulation. He had no rash, and no palpable lymphadenopathy was found.
Blood analysis showed mild anemia (hemoglobin 11.3g/dL) with iron and folic acid deficiency, low serum albumin (2.3g/dL), elevated C-reactive protein (101.5mg/L) anderythrocyte sedimentation rate (55mm/h). White blood cells (WBC) and platelet counts, coagulation tests, serum bilirubin(total and conjugated), aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase and serum pancreatic enzymes were within normal range. Albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 110mg/g. Thyroid and renal functions were normal. Hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus infection were excluded. Immunological study was negative. Abdominal ultrasound was inconclusive, and an abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast was performed, showing large ascites and signs of chronic hepatopathy, and excluding other lesions.
Paracentesis was performed and yellowish ascitic fluid was obtained; analysis serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was 0.7g/dL, with high total protein (4.4g/dL), low glucose (65mg/dL), high lactate dehydrogenase (309U/L), normal amylase (43UI/L) and adenosine deaminase (32UI/L). Differential cell count was 610WBC/mm3with lymphocyte predominance (51%). Ascitic cytology was negative for malignancy; cultures, including for acid-fast bacilli, were negative. Bacterial DNA ofMycobacterium tuberculosiswas not detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification on ascitic fluid.
Thoracic CT scan, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy were normal.
The etiology remained unknown, therefore a laparoscopy was performed: at inspection, the peritoneum appeared thickened; biopsy of peritoneum has been performed and six liters of serous ascitic fluid were removed. On histologic (Figure 1) and immunohistochemical analysis, MPM  epithelioid subtype was diagnosed. Tumor cells were positive for calretinin (Figure 2A), cytokeratin 5/6 (Figure 2B), podoplanin andWilms tumor 1 antigen(WT1), and they were negative for cytokeratin 20, PAX-8 and Ber EP4 (Figure 2C). Tumor cells also showed a nuclear loss ofBRCA-1 associated protein 1(BAP1) (Figure 2D).
The patient was referred to the Oncology Department but, unfortunately, he died one week after diagnosis before any specific treatment could be administered.

"CASE DESCRIPTION:
A 66-year-old caucasian man with no relevant past medical history and no habitual medications presents with a one-week history of unusual symptoms of insomnia, agitation, and anxiety. Drugs and alcohol were immediately excluded. Blood tests were only remarkable to a new onset thrombocytopenia (77.000/µl). After psychiatric evaluation, a benzodiazepine was prescribed, and he was discharged.
A week later he returns with the same psychiatric symptoms and a new onset oromandibular dyskinesia and was admitted for complementary study. The next day he showed disorganized speech and behaviour as well as visual hallucinations and was medicated with haloperidol and chlorpromazine with little success; later that day he initiated a very hard to manage choreic disorder leading to initiation of profound sedation and consequent endotracheal intubation for airway protection. Cranial CT scan showed no alterations and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had some nonspecific white-matter hyperintensities on T2 and FLAIR sequences at the frontal lobe. A cranial MRI angiography was performed showing enlargement of peripheral cerebrospinal fluid spaces compatible with cortical atrophy and small white-matter hyperintensities affecting the corona radiata and the centrum semiovale, suggestive of vasculopathy. An electroencephalogram was performed with no epileptiform activity. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were mostly normal as there was only found 2 oligoclonal IgG bands, but albumin and IgG quotients were normal and anti-NDMA receptor antibody was negative. Neurotropic infectious pathogens were excluded and cultures were negative for bacteria and mycobacteria (Table 1). HIV types 1/2, HCV, HBV and treponemal test were negative. A thoracoabdominal-pelvic CT scan was also performed with no relevant changes. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 111 mm/hour. From the auto-immune study we highlight positive antinuclear antibodies (1:640) as well as strong postive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPA)  lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody and anti-glycoprotein 2 antibody; there was also complement consumption (both C3 and C4) (Table 2). These tests were repeated after 12 weeks remaining positive.
SLE diagnosis was made based in the new European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria.
After initiating high dose pulse intravenous steroids with 1g of methylprednisolone given daily for three days our patient showed great improvement. He was later discharged with hydroxychloroquine, antiplatelet therapy and oral corticosteroid (prednisolone) that has been successfully tapered in follow-up appointments.

"Case report
We describe the case of a 54-year old woman with history of pulmonary tuberculosis (PT) in childhood and acute herpes zoster of the left cervical region with postherpetic neuralgia two years prior to the admission in our hospital. There was a recent contact with a relative with PT, four months prior to our observation. She presented with left anterior cervical discomfort and tumefaction over the past eight weeks, associated in the last three weeks with left frontotemporal headache, vespertine fever, night sweats, malaise, myalgia, anorexia and significant weight loss (9% of total body weight). She denied palpitations, insomnia, tremors, or the appearance of any rash, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, as well as urinary, respiratory or abdominal symptoms.
On observation, the patient was pale, apyretic, eupnoeic, with normal arterial blood pressure 111/62mmHg but steadily tachycardic with 110 beats per minute. Cervical palpation revealed an enlarged and tender thyroid gland without other local inflammatory signs, no palpable nodules, temporal artery was not palpable and cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal.
Laboratory results revealed an inflammatory normocytic normochromic anaemia with haemoglobin 10.6g/dL, ferritin was elevated 312.4μg/L (normal range 10.0 to 120.0μg/L), sideraemia, transferrin saturation, vitamin B12 and folic acid were normal. ERS and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated: VS 124mm/h (normal <30mm/h) and CRP 3.45mg/dL (normal <0.5mg/dL). Plasmatic protein electrophoresis was normal. Mild elevation of liver biochemical tests less than two times the upper limit of normal (aspartate aminotransferase 25UI/L, alanine aminotransferase 67UI/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase 118UI/L, alkaline phosphatase 151UI/L). A viral, bacterial and protozoal serologies panel was performed (including HIV, hepatitis B and C, Herpes simplex 1 and 2, Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Brucella spp, Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia rickettsia, Rickettsia typhi, Coxiella burnetti and Leishmania donovani), all negative except evidence of past Herpes simplex 1 and Cytomegalovirus contact (IgG+/IgM-). Blood cultures were negative. Thyroid function tests showed a suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level of <0.01mUI/L (normal range 0.27 to 4.2mUI/L) and elevated levels of free thyroxine (fT4) 72.1pmol/L (normal range 12.0 to 22.0pmol/L), total triiodothyronine 5.88nmol/L (normal range 0.9 to 2.8nmol/L) and free triiodothyronine 22.9pmol/L (normal range 3.5 to 6.5pmol/L). Anti-thyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, and anti-thyrotropin receptor antibodies were negative. Antinuclear antibodies test was negative.
The cervical ultrasonography (US) revealed a globose gland with a diffusely and heterogeneous structure, with bands of hypoechogenicity, suggestive of subacute/chronic thyroiditis (Fig. 1).
An abdominal US and thoracic, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan showed no significant alterations, specifically absence of enlarged lymph nodes or parenchymal nodules of the lung, liver or spleen.
The diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis was made and the patient was started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen 500mg on demand).
During hospital stay, the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis subsided and biochemical euthyroidism was reached four weeks later. The remaining laboratory results such as haemoglobin and ESR also normalized, maintaining mild elevation of hepatic enzymes.
Discussion"
"Clinical case
A 55-year-oldCaucasian male, was admitted to the Neurology ward due to distal, symmetrical lower limb (LL) weakness. In the previous 4 weeks, he reported paraesthesia in both hands that extended proximally to the arms. Neurological examination disclosed distal paraparesis (grade 4), absent deep tendon reflexes, hypoesthesia in a socks distribution and abolition of vibratory and postural sensationsin distal LL.Physicalexam was otherwise unremarkable. Prior medical history included smoking and pulmonary tuberculosis. Electromyogram (EMG) performed at admission showed slight distal demyelination of the right median and left posterior tibial nerves. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytochemical and bacteriologic analysis were normal (CSF: 0,8/mm3 cells, glucose 5 mmol/l, proteins 0,39 g/l). Laboratory workup revealed normochromic normocytic anaemia (Hb 10,9 g/dL), with normal levels of iron, ferritin and total iron binding capacity. Elevated ESR (113 mm); serum glucose 9,4 mmol/l, proteins 97 g/l;IgM/K monoclonal gammapathy(IgG 24,4 g/L, IgM 13,4 g/L  6 times the upper limit of normal, k-chains 7,05 g/L); absence of Bence Jones proteinuria; normal B2 microglobulin levels.Positive ANA (1/160) and anti-SSA antibodies.Positive Anti-HBCantibody; negative HIV serology. Positive anti-ganglioside antibodies(IgM GM3 - 1/2000, GD3 - 1/5000 and GM4 - 1/2000); negative anti-MAG, anti-Ri, anti-Hu e anti-Yo antibodies. Skeleton x-ray revealed no lytic bone lesions;normal thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan.Spinal MRI (Fig. 1) showed altered signal in T1W and T2Wimages in the vertebral bodies suggesting diffuse bone marrow infiltration. The myelogram revealed a normocelular bone marrow and a myeloid/erythroid shift, with 5% lymphocytes and 1% plasmocytes. The first bone marrow biopsy (BMB) was inconclusive and he started corticotherapy 1 mg/Kg/day, without improvement. A second EMG, performed 3 weeks later, showed significantworsening of the neurophysiological picture with marked distal demyelinationin upper and lower limbsand nerve conduction blocks, fulfilling criteria for CIDP.A second CSF analysis revealed albumin-cytological dissociation (CSF: 2,4/mm3 cells, glucose 3,2 mmol/l, proteins 0,56 g/l).
Despite the administration of two IV immunoglobulin pulses, on the 16th week there was clinical progression to tetraparesis(muscle strength grade 3) and global respiratory insufficiency aggravated by pneumonia, which required UCI admission and invasive mechanical ventilation support. The third EMG revealed significant neurophysiological worsening and moderate demyelination of the phrenic nerves. A second BMB (Fig. 2) confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoplasmocytic NHL, and the patient started chemotherapy with Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine and Prednisolone (CHOP) still in the ICU, without clinical improvement. A 2nd and 3rd chemotherapy cycles with Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Etoposide (vincristine was replaced by Etoposide due to its putative neurological toxicity) and Prednisolone (R-CHEP) associated with Rituximab, were prescribed with evident neurological and neurophysiological improvement. The patient resumed daily life activities within 2 months, but not work (watchmaker). The EMG performed 1 year later was normal, while the underlying haematological condition was under remission, confirmed both clinically and by bone marrow analysis.
DISCUSSION"
"Case Presentation
We present the case of a 47 year-old caucasian, homosexual male with no relevant past medical or surgical history. The patient reported high-risk behaviours for sexually transmitted diseases (a new male sexual partner in recent months and unprotected anal-receptive intercourse).He had no history of liver disease, minimal alcohol consumption, and no use of acetaminophen, herbals supplements, or over-the-counter products. He denied tobacco use, and had never used intravenous drugs nor had he ever received a transfusion. At the time of presentation to the emergency department, the patient reported fever accompanied by generalised pruritic rash, dark urine and fecal acholia with two weeks of evolution. Two weeks prior to presentation he was evaluated at an outside emergency department for fever and skin lesions involving the palms and soles, as well as abdominal pain and he was treated with antibiotics without clinical improvement.
On physical examination, the patient was conscious, alert and jaundiced. Vital signs were normal. There was scleral icterus, the mouth and oral pharynx appeared normal, and there was no palpable lymphadenopathy or flapping. Cardiovascular and pulmonary exams were normal. The abdomen was soft with normal bowel sounds, non-tender, non-distended, and without hepatosplenomegaly, masses, or dullness at the flanks. Both the rectal and genital exams were normal. Skin examination revealed macular erythematous lesions on the trunk, limbs, palms and soles, jaundice, but stigmata of liver disease was not observed.
From the complementary study performed during his hospitalization, we can highlight a mixed hyperbilirrubinaemia (total bilirrubin 52umol/L), increased activity of the serum enzymes alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gama-glutammyltransferase (γ-GT) and aminotransferases (ALT and AST) levels and still negative serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A, B and C, epstein-barr, herpes simplex, and cytomegalovirus. Additional laboratory studies revealed a normal complete blood countas well as international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time and albumin were unaltered. The imagiological study excluded biliary tract obstruction with abdominal ultrasound showing homogeneous liver parenchyma without biliary ductal dilation, cholelithiasis, or cholecystitis.
Syphilis screening (VDRL/RPR) was positive, with titers of 1:64 (Table 1)and confirmatoryand confirmatory antitreponemal antibody test specifically theTreponema pallidumconfirmed active infection. Autoimmune and metabolic workup for liver disease including anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), liver kidney microsomal (LKM) antibody, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) was tested negative. Metabolic profiles including iron studies, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin and celiac panel were normal. An ultrasound-guided core liver biopsy was performed and histopathology examination (Figure 1) showed acute hepatitis with mild activity (grade 2 of 4), portal and peri-portal fibrosis with no fibrous septa (stage 1 of 4).
Taken together, diagnosis of secondary syphilis with luetic hepatitis was made and the patient was treated with a single dose of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly. He showed symptomatic improvement subsequently, including resolution of fever and abdominal pain. He was discharged to be followed up outpatient. Follow-up visit in two weeks revealed improvement in serum biochemical tests with ALT of 141 U/L, AST 68 of U/L, γ-GT of 720 IU/L, ALP of 324 IU/L (Table 1), and absence of fever, abdominal pain and skin lesions. Six and twelve months after therapy, VDRL was nonreactive and liver chemistries normalized entirely as presented in Table 1.
Discussion Syphilis remains an under-diagnosed condition, mainly due to low clinical suspicion. Indeed, syphilitic infection can be a difficult diagnosis to make due to the wide variation of clinical symptoms that are associated with the disease.6"
"CASE REPORT
We report a case of a 47-year-old female patient with relapsing-remitting MS, diagnosed 18 years ago and medicated with IFN-β 1-a (44mg, 3 times/week) since then. She had no other known medical conditions neither was under other medical treatment. There was no history of allergies.
The patient presented to the ED referring 8-day left eye hypovision. On physical examination, relevant findings were grade 3 HTN (blood pressure of 240/110 mmHg), bilateral upper-limb petechiae and mild hand and periorbital edema. Ocular fundus examination revealed grade III retinopathy.
Initial complementary exams performed demonstrated a TMA, composed of MAHA (hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL; undetectable haptoglobin; lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] of 715 U/L; total bilirubin of 1.1 mg/dL; peripheral blood smear evidencing schistocytes; negative direct coombs test) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 57 000). Acute kidney injury (AKI) (serum creatinine of 3.7 mg/dL) was also present and urinary sediment revealed non-dysmorphic erythrocytes and proteinuria. Spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio estimated a 24h proteinuria of 4g. Serum albumin was normal. Renal doppler ultrasound revealed symmetric normodimensioned kidneys and renal artery stenosis was excluded. Additionally, secondary myocardial injury (troponin level of 52.1 ng/L) was documented, with no electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia. Echocardiogram evidenced normal thickened ventricular walls, no segmental kinetic changes, normal diastolic pattern and preserved ejection fraction. A cranioencephalic computed tomography scan was performed and excluded ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions.
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and blood pressure lowering was immediately initiated with labetalol. Of the remaining complementary study gradually available, immunological study was unremarkable (antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, antitopoisomerase I, anticentromere-B, antiglomerular basement membrane and antiphospholipid antibodies were negative as were rheumatoid factor) and there was no evidence of complement consumption. Also, HCV, HBV and HIV serologies were negative. In the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, Shiga-toxin was not tested for. The ADAMTS 13 activity was normal. Additional causes of secondary HTN were also excluded (normal plasma and urinary 24h fractionated metanephrines, normal TSH and free-T4 and normal 24h urinary-free cortisol). Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis study was deferred because patient was under non-neutral treatment.
The diagnosis of INF-induced TMA was considered the most likely and IFN-β was withdrawal. Switch to oral anti-hypertensive drugs was made and blood pressure was maintained within the recommended targets. Hemolysis and thrombocytopenia resolved progressively, and serum creatinine decreased until it stabilized at value of 2.5 mg/dL.The patient was discharged at day 7, medicated with perindopril 10mg, amlodipine 10mg, furosemide 40mg and bisoprolol 5mg. During follow-up anti-hypertensive therapy was successfully down-titrated to perindopril 10mg, amlodipine 5mg and furosemide 40mg.During follow-up anti-hypertensive therapy was successfully down-titrated. There was no further evidence of hemolysis and kidney function improved progressively (at the 5 months follow up, serum creatinine was 1.5 mg/dL; CKD-EPI glomerular filtration rate of 41 mL/min/1.73m²). There was also no relapsing of MS.
DISCUSSION"
"Case Report:
A 38-year-old woman, farmer, is hospitalized with progressive asthenia, fatigue, and proximal and symmetrical muscle weakness, involving the scapular and pelvic girdles with four months of evolution. Diffuse muscle pain and limiting functional impact were also mentioned.
The patient reported violaceous maculopapular erythema on her face and back associated with scaly and pruritic erythema on the back of the hands. She denied using new products for hygiene, cleaning or work-related, or new medications.
Physical examination revealed facial oedema and erythema, as well as on the neck and back, with a shawl sign. On the hands, hyperpigmented papular lesions were present, on metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally, compatible with Gottron´s papules (Fig. 1). Proximal muscle strength was decreased on upper and lower limbs, with preserved muscle tone and osteotendinous reflexes.
Laboratory studies demonstrated elevation of creatine kinase (CK), with a maximum value of 674 U/L (four times the upper limit of normal). Autoimmunity was positive for myositis, with the presence of anti-TIF-1-γ antibodies. There were no signs of systemic inflammation, with persistently low erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Serological viral markers and infectious serologies were negative.
Complementary studies, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electromyography, were compatible with inflammatory myositis. Muscle biopsy revealed inflammatory infiltrates, without autophagic vacuoles or amyloid deposits.
Malignancy was excluded through computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, endoscopic study, mammography and cervicovaginal cytology. In addition, interstitial lung disease was excluded as well as cardiac or digestive involvement.
Fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of dermatomyositis, the patient was prescribed with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg per day, prednisolone 1 mg/kg per day and azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg per day, in association with a physical rehabilitation program.
The patient was discharged after 13 days, with gradual improvement of all symptoms. Minimal residual disease was achieved six months after initial diagnosis, with no functional limitation on daily activities.
Maintaining follow-up on outpatient consultations, no new symptoms or laboratory abnormalities were described until a year after the diagnosis. At that time, the patient experienced a new onset of confusion, jaundice, postprandial infarction, and an increase in abdominal volume. CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and liver biopsy, revealed metastatic lesions from cancer of an unknown primary site. Mammography and ultrasound uncovered multiple microcalcifications and axillary lymphadenopathy, suggesting metastatic breast cancer. Due to acute liver failure and patient clinical deterioration, breast biopsy was not performed, and taxane-based chemotherapy was started. Despite the treatment, the patient evolved unfavourably and died six days later from progressive disease.

"Clinical Case
A 81 year-old man presented with an one year history of lumbago. He was a frequent consumer of unpasteurized dairy products and had no history of travel outside Europe. Thoracic computerized tomography [CT] and pulmonary bronchofibroscopy had been performed eleven years earlier because of hemoptysis, cough and a pulmonary lesion. Bronchoalveolar lavage culture revealed Mycobacterium tuberculosis [MT]. The patient was lost to follow-up and as he had no more symptoms, no treatment was initiated. Others major pathologies of his background were hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and ischemic and hypertensive heart disease.
The patient was diagnosed with lumbar strain and medicated with analgesics. As a mechanical lumbar pain persisted, acupuncture was performed and the patient suffered a third degree burn. He had no history of fever, weight loss or anorexia. Also, there was no history of traumatic injury. On physical examination, no abnormalities were noted, including neurological deficits.Given the persistence and worsening of the lumbar pain, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] was performed, revealing marked bone destruction of L4 and L5 and adjacent areas sclerosis and edema in the bone marrow, edema in areas of the body L3 and collapse and reduction of amplitude of intersomatic space of L4 and L5. Indentation of L4 and L5 wall was conditioning reduction of vertebral canal amplitude and infectious componentsin epidural canal in L3-L4, L4 -L5 and L5-S1 conditioned compression of the thecal sac. There were also a paraspinal left side infectious collection in the psoas muscle in continuity with the epidural collection of L3 -L4 with 36x21mm.
The patient was then hospitalized in our department to pursue investigation. As the patient had multiple predisposing factors for different pathogens, etiological differential diagnosis included MT, Brucella and Gram-positive cocci. As the patient was stable, no empirical antibiotics were initiated.On admission, the erythrocyte serum sedimentation rate was normal [22mm/h], Human Immunodeficiency Virus was negative; and all other blood tests were unremarkable.Transthoracic echocardiogram was normal and blood cultures were negative. Bone marrow and sputum culture were negative.CT-guided paravertebral abscess aspiration was performed. Cultures were negative but DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, making a final diagnosis of Potts disease.
Treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol was initiated.
After initiation of the treatment and evaluation of its tolerability, the patient was discharged. After two months of quadruple therapy, he maintained isoniazid and rifampicin only during the next 7 months. The patient maintained follow-up in our clinic and showed both clinical and radiological amelioration. As he had no neurologic symptoms, neurosurgery was deemed unnecessary.

A 78-year-old man, with history of arterial hypertension and smoking (120 pack years) presented to the emergency department with bitemporal and occipital headache and episodes of bilateral scotomas and transient bilateral visual loss with a duration of a few minutes for the past fifteen days. For the past 24 hours he also presented periods of confusion, right hemiparesis (muscle strength grade 3/5), right hemihypoesthesia, central right facial paralysis and paralysis of the left third cranial nerve. The patient had lost 11% of his body weight during the past month. He denied pain in his joints, mandibular claudication, fever, myalgias or symmetrical loss of strength in scapular or pelvic girdle.
His initial laboratory workout was unremarkable, with a normal serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and ESR 29mm/hr (normal less than 22mm/hr). Head CT scan showed a discrete hypodensity near the left superiorcorona radiatawith no mass effect, probably with a vascular origin and impossible to datewith this imaging technique (Fig. 1). Doppler ultrasound of the temporal arteries showed permeability of all studied segments, highlighting the increase in flow velocity in the left middle cerebral artery, right vertebral artery and basilary artery and increased pulsatility indexes, reflecting arterial inelasticity. Permeability of both superficial temporal arteries, frontal and parietal branches, with extensive fibrous and hypoechoic reinforcement of the arterial wall along both arterial axes, protruding into the arterial lumen, causing an increase in flow velocity, suggestive of stenosis. These findings are suggestive of an inflammatory process in the arterial wall.
The patient was admitted to the internal medicine ward under the suspicion of GCA with Weber syndrome. In view of possible cerebrovascular vasculitic involvement, the patient was started on methylprednisolone 1g for three days, and after that oral prednisolone 1mg/kg/day. Brain MRI performed on the forth day after admission revealed new ischemic infarcts in the vertebrobasilar territory and left medium cerebral artery (Fig. 2).
Bilateral temporal artery biopsies were done on the 7th day of hospitalization and were positive for GCA showing transmural inflammation and the presence of multi-nucleated giant cells in the arterial walls (Figures 3A and 3B, 4 and 5).
The patient gradually worsened his neurologic status, increasing the degree of paralysis, and developing ataxia and dysarthria. He was started on cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2on the 18thday after admission. The patient died of nosocomial pneumonia 41 days after hospital admission.

"Case report
An 86-year-old Caucasian woman, previously well and independent, presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of malaise, fatigue, orthopnoea and discrete oedema on both hands and ankles for six months, worsening in the last month. She also had anorexia, dyspepsia and weight loss (10kg in the past six months). There were no palpitations, chest pain, urinary or other gastrointestinal symptoms. She had hypertension, dyslipidaemia and chronic anaemia without prior investigation. Her daily medication included carvedilol, perindopril, valsartan + hydrochlorothiazide and simvastatin.
On observation, she was pale, hydrated, oriented to person and place, but not to time and a brief neurologic examination did not reveal other changes. She was haemodynamically stable, eupnoeic with discrete bibasilar crackles in the pulmonary auscultation and febrile (tympanic temperature: 38.4ºC). She had slight oedema on both hands with painful joint palpation, local hyperaemia on the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints and bimalleolar oedema.
The initial blood tests (Table 1) revealed a hypochromic microcytic anaemia, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 68mg/L without leucocytosis, normal kidney function, hyponatremia of 124mEq/L with no other electrolyte imbalances and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 293pg/mL.The electrocardiogram was normal; chest radiograph showed bilateral reticular pattern.
On admission to our ward, her medication was discontinued and further workup was started. The calculated plasma osmolality was decreased (265mOsmol/kg). The absence of jugular engorgement, a very modest BNP elevation and a transthoracic echocardiogram without changes suggestive of heart failure made a hypervolemic cardiac cause for her hyponatremia less likely. Her peripheral oedema seemed to be caused by hypoalbuminemia instead of water retention. The patient was considered euvolemic and a 24h urine analysis was requested, with: increased osmolality of 510mOsmol/kg, high sodium levels of 69mEq/L, potassium 41.4mEq/L, glucose <1.0 mg/dL, urea 17.3 g/L and creatinine 602mg/24h. Her thyroid and adrenal functions were normal, her medication was reviewed and considered innocuous in this case. A diagnosis of SIADH was therefore considered the most likely cause for this hyponatremia. The patients complaints of weight loss, anorexia and chronic anaemia prompted investigation of a possible neoplastic cause.
We performed a thoraco-abdominopelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (Fig. 1) revealing mild reticulation in both lungs, traction bronchiolectasis and honeycombing, a discrete bilateral pleural effusion, hepatomegaly with regular boundaries and no parenchymal suspected lesions and a distended stomach with diffuse parietal thickening on the pre-pyloric region. It also described a diffuse irregularity on the cortical region of the right humeral diaphysis suggestive of an infiltrative tumoral lesion. Taking these alterations into account, she underwent endoscopic evaluation. Upper endoscopy revealed superficial gastropathy positive for Helicobacter pyloriand colonoscopy a single 2mm sessile rectal polyp. A brain magnetic resonance imaging showed signs of chronic ischemic microangiopathic leukoencephalopathy and a non-recent area of lacunar infarction on the left corona radiata; no other relevant changes were found, namely on the pituitary gland. The HIV, HBV and HCV screenings, VDRL test and IGRA were all negative. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Protein electrophoresis had total proteins of 62.5g/L with reduced albumin/globulin fraction (0.6) and bisalbuminaemia, elevated beta-2-globulins (13.7%) and gamma-globulins (22.2%). The patient also had an elevated beta-2-microglobulin (6.89 mg/L). Immunofixation electrophoresis revealed a slight polyclonal elevation of all immunoglobulins.
The whole-body bone scintigraphy (Fig. 2) showed generalized hypercaptation of the isotope by the joints on both shoulders, elbows, wrists, carpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, hips, knees, tibiotarsic, tarsometatarsic and metatarsophalangeal joints and there were no signs of secondary bone involvement. Considering these findings, we requested an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and auto-immunity panel with the following changes: ESR 65mm/h, rheumatoid factor 3160UI/mL and anticitrullinated antibodies 2777UQ. The patients clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with a definite diagnosis of RA according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria6 (Table 2) with high activity using the Disease Activity Score-28 with ESR.7 Figure 3 depicts the patients hands and feet. Hands X-ray (Fig. 4) showed diffuse osteopenia, boutonniere deformity, erosions on the articular surface of the first metacarpophalangeal joint of the first fingers and erosions with surface destruction of all proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally. The lung CT findings were also supportive of this diagnosis.8
With an initial fluid restriction strategy and 40 mg of intravenous furosemide daily in an attempt to improve the patients urinary output, the sodium levels worsened to 112mEq/L on the 8th hospital day. Afterwards we opted by keeping the fluid restriction combined with 1500mL of isotonic saline with a 4g supplement of hypertonic saline and 40 mg of oral furosemide per day, with some improvement of the sodium levels (120mEq/L on the 12th day). After diagnosing RA, on the 14th day we introduced deflazacort 15 mg/day and methotrexate 15 mg/week, after which we observed a rise in sodium levels up to 132mEq/L on the 18th day. Her hospital stay was complicated by a nosocomial pneumonia and she died on the 23rd day.

"Case Report
A 62-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a five days history of high-grade fever, chills, anorexia, mild diarrhea, dry cough, and exuberant and progressive disequilibrium and dysarthria. He was already under amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, after been observed by his primary care doctor two days before.
He had a past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He was a non-smoker, worked as chief observer at the portuguese electricity company, had no contact with animals or other sick People and had been travelling in Portugal in the past two weeks, sleeping in different hotels without air conditioning.
Upon admission he was tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 92%, pulmonary auscultation revealed crackles in the lower third of the right hemithorax, gait ataxia, dysarthria and dysmetria were also identified. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory abnormalities were as shown in table 1. Chest x-ray showed a consolidation pattern in the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia (figure 1). Head computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show any abnormality.
He was admitted to the Intermediate Care Unit with the diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) with multi-organ dysfunction, and was empirically treated with a combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and azithromycin. On the next dayLegionella serogroup 1 urinary antigen was positive. All other microbiologic exams were negative. Treatment with azithromycin was continued for 14 days. All symptoms and dysfunctions improved gradually and he was discharged after eight days of hospitalization. The public health authorities conducted an epidemiologic investigation, but did not found any outbreak or the source of disease.
Follow-up at one month showed complete resolution of the neurologic deficits. Radiologic and analytic abnormalities were also resolved by this time, and seroconvertion IgM/IgG of Legionella serology was also identified.

"Case description
70 year-old male, with history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (with good metabolic control but with suspected diabetic kidney disease), presented to emergency room with vomits, malaise and fever (tympanic temperature 39.2ºC). Physical examination revealed an aortic systolic murmur III/VI, precarious oral hygiene and edentulism. Blood tests revealed leukocytosis (18.20x109/L) with neutrophilia (16.80x109/L), serum creatinine 1.20mg/dL and C-reactive protein 3.93mg/dL. Blood cultures and urine culture were performed and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was initiated. Patient was admitted into a ward.
Three days after admission, MSSA was isolated in blood cultures and antibiotics were adjusted to flucloxacillin and gentamycin. After transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a vegetation on a native bicuspid aortic valve, infectious endocarditis was diagnosed, given that 2 major Duke criteria for endocarditis were fulfilled. Gentamycin was later discontinued since it was a MSSA endocarditis.
On the 13thday of antibiotic therapy, the patient showed deterioration of renal function, with maximum serum creatinine 4.70 mg/dL, despite discontinuation of all potential nephrotoxic drugs with worsen hypertension control and development of peripheric edema.
Urine sample revealed microscopic hematuria and proteinuria of 1925mg/24h. HIV, HBV and HCV serologies were negative. Anti ds-DNA, ANAs, ANCAs and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody were negative. Anti-Streptolysin levels were within normal range. C3 and C4 level were normal. Immunoglobulin levels were normal.
Renal biopsy was performed and revealed glomeruli with mild mesangial and moderate endocapillary hypercellularity (Fig. 1), with crescents, mild tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis and acute interstitial nephritis with eosinophils (Fig. 2). Immunofluorescence showed dominant IgA and C3 deposition with fine granular deposits with mesangial dominance. Staining for IgG, IgM, fibrinogen, C1q, κ and λ chains was negative. Electron microscopy was not performed. Proliferative GN with IgA and C3 deposits was diagnosed, compatible with IgA dominant APIGN. The biopsy also revealed acute interstitial nephritis due to nephrotoxicity.

"CASE REPORT
We are presenting a 28-year-old male patient with five years history of RA, under methotrexate 10 mg/week, in remission according to disease activity score-28 (DAS28). In routine monitoring, he reported, in the previous month, flu-like symptoms (asthenia, myalgias, sudoresis, without fever) like his child, resolved within one week. He denied cough, loss of weight, abdominal pain, pruritus or other symptoms since then. Physical examination was unremarkable. Highlighted on laboratory tests (Table 1) was relative lymphocytosis (3 100 x109/L), without leukocytosis or neutrophilia, peripheral blood smear with reactive lymphocytes, neutrophils with toxic granulations and slightly elevated aminotransferases (aspartate transaminase 35 U/L and alanine transaminase 67 U/L). Relative lymphocytosis and hepatitis were interpreted as a probable viral infection. However, since liver toxicity due to methotrexate could not be ruled out, it´s dose was reduced to 7,5 mg/week. Four months later, the symptoms resolved, the physical examination was normal (without palpable liver or lymphadenopathies) and the transaminases normalized. However, relative lymphocytosis (2 900 x109/L) remained (Table 1).
Additional tests were performed, including lactate dehydrogenase which was normal, cytomegalovirus (CMV) serologies suggesting recent infection, Epstein-Barr virus and toxoplasma serologies suggested previous infection, screening for syphilis (with venereal disease research laboratory) and human immunodeficiency virus which were negative. Given the higher risk of lymphoma in this patient, a thoraco-abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a triangular homogenous mass on anterior mediastinum, with 37x19 mm (Fig. 1), suggesting TH, hepatomegaly (16,1 cm on middle-clavicular line) and slight splenomegaly (bipolar diameter of 13,3 cm). Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were negative, and thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a triangular homogenous mass on anterior mediastinum, with 39x19 mm and preserved adjacent fat planes, compatible with TH (Fig. 2).
We opted for watchful waiting and close follow-up. The patient remained asymptomatic, abdominal ultrasound three months later showed a morphologically and dimensionally normal liver and spleen. Thoracic MRI six months later showed dimension stability of anterior mediastinal mass. Analytical reassessment showed persistent relative lymphocytosis without morphologically alterations. One year later CMV serology showed similar results.
DISCUSSION"
"CASE REPORT
A 72-year-old man presented at the emergency room with blurred vision in the right eye, slurred speech and dysphagia for the two previous days. His medical background included a stable multiple myeloma, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. He referred having taken the flu vaccine 5 months before admission and having flu symptoms for the last 2 weeks.
At the emergency room, he was vigil, had a slurred but coherent speech with dysarthria, was able to name and repeat. He presented left eyelid ptosis, no visual field loss and isochoric pupils with pupillary reflexes present. (figure 1) Left extraocular movements were reduced and the patient wasnt capable of abducting the left eye. He presented left facial paralysis. (figure 2) No muscle strength or sensitivity loss were referred. Cerebellar tests had no changes.
Blood analyses were normal. He performed a cerebral and cervical simple and angio computed tomography revealing no parenchymal or vascular lesions, but showing multiple lytic injuries of cervical vertebrae. The patient was admitted for study.
During his hospital stay, he maintained his neurologic deficits. During the first days, he further presented limitation of the abduction of both eyes, diplopia that was corrected with monocular occlusion, severe dysphagia, distal left arm muscle strength reduction (moved against gravity but without resistance).
At this point four major diagnoses were under consideration: Ischemic stroke, oncologic progression, Central Nervous System infection and MFS. Blood analysis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) didnt show any alterations. We contacted Neuroradiology colleagues and the patients Hematologist to review MRI images and his oncology state and oncologic disease progression was excluded.
On the 5th day, the patient progressed to left eyelid ptosis, abduction limitation of both eyes, left facial paralysis, lower-right facial paralysis, dysarthria, left finger-nose test dysmetria and reduced, symmetrical, bilateral osteotendinous reflexes (bicipital, radial and aquilian).
We performed a lumbar puncture (LP) and cerebrospinal liquor was sent to cell counting, biochemistry, microbiology (bacteria, mycobacteria and viral panel) and antiganglioside GQ1b antibody investigation. LP results revealed 2 leucocytes and no albumino-cytologic dissociation.
On the same day, the patient had a pulmonary arrest needing orotracheal intubation and an Intensive Care Unit. At this moment, the patient presented complete ophthalmoplegia, left ptosis, bilateral facial paralysis, dysphagia, dysarthria, respiratory failure, reduced muscle strength in the 4 limbs and generalized areflexia. He started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 30g/day (0,4g/kg) for 5 days for the presumptive diagnosis of Guillain Barré Syndrome (Miller-Fisher variant). He did an electromyography that revealed a peripheral sensorimotor polyneuropathy in the upper and lower limbs, axonal lesion in facial and trigeminal nerves and absent cubital F-wave and prolonged posterior tibial F-wave, findings consistent with Miller-Fisher Syndrome. Campylobacter was identified in the patients stool through polymerase chain reaction methods, although he never presented gastrointestinal symptoms.
The internment was longer than expected due to lower tract respiratory infections.
On the 10th day, the patient was extubated and needed a tracheostomy (image 3); on the 20th he initiated a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme with physiotherapy, occupational and speech therapy and on the 26th day he was able to stand up by himself in order to move into the chair. On the 30th day a percutaneous gastrostomy was done and he started on an individualized nutritional programme. On the 54th day the tracheostomy was closed.
The patient was discharged on the 73rd day, presenting a fluent speech with minor dysarthria and no ocular movement loss. He presented grade 4 muscle strength in both upper and lower limbs and he was able to stand up and walk helped by a 2nd person. (image 4).
Due to hospital policies, GQ1b antibodies were only collected 115 days after admission and the results were negative.
DISCUSSION"
"CASE DESCRIPTION
An 86-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with involuntary movements of the left limbs and a seven-day history of polydipsia. The patient and the family denied any adittional symptoms, exposure to toxins or newly introduced medications.
The patient had previous history of arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dementia and had a knee replacement surgery (date of procedure was not specified). She attended a private practice neurology clinic for her initial dementia diagnosis and was being medicated for six months with prednisolone 20mg alternating with 10mg/day. The rational for this therapy was unclear as we did not have access to her previous clinical file and neither the patient nor the family could provide any additional explanation.
She was agitated, verborrheic and with choreic movements of the left arm and foot on admission. She was hemodynamically stable with a tympanic temperature of 36,5ºC. Her blood tests revealed hyperglycemia (513mg/dL, with glycated haemoglobin of 11,9%) and excluded ketoacidosis. No evidence of acute disease was shown on head computer tomography (CT) scan.
The diagnosis of stroke of the basal nuclei versus chorea following hyperglycemia was considered, as well as newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Insulin therapy was strated in the emergency department and the patient was admitted to an internal medicine ward for treatment and further investigation.
At this point, corticotherapy seemed to be the cause of the patients hyperglycemia. After thorough investigation and careful consideration, no clear reason was found to support its need, so prednisolone was weaned.
Improvement of the clinical manifestations was observed after correction of glycemia and after eight days of treatment the involuntary movements had ceased and the patient was discharged under insulin therapy.
Brain magnetic resonance (MRI) could not be performed due to the patients knee prosthetics. However, clinical evolution enabled the final diagnosis of a movement disorder associated with non ketotic hyperglycemia.
After discharge, the patient attended the outpatient Diabetes clinic for 6 months and then failed the following appointments. Corticotherapy was fully weaned, and it was also possible to stop insulin. Patient maintained euglycemia for four months after discharge without any new hyperglycemic values. Thus, the diagnosis of diabetes secondary to corticotherapy was made. The patient died after some months due to non-disclosed causes.

"CASE DESCRIPTION
The authors describe the case of a 38-year-old woman with history of major depressive disorder, multiple previous suicide attempts and an addictive behaviour with chronic abuse of benzodiazepines, acetaminophen and codeine with progressive dosage increase over the last ten years. She had an estimated daily consumption of 20mg of alprazolam, 5g of acetaminophen and 300mg of codeine.
She was admitted in an intensive care unit (ICU) after voluntary drug overdose with 15g of acetaminophen, 900mg of codeine, 3g of venlafaxine, 40mg of alprazolam and 9g of quetiapine that led to coma. On admission to the ICU she had multiorgan failure, with severe neurologic, respiratory, cardiovascular and hepatic dysfunctions and supportive care was provided. Vasopressorsupport with norepinephrine was required during the first five days of hospital stay, due to the severe distributive shock the patient had. ICU stay was complicated by nosocomial pneumonia with severe respiratory failure, with subsequent initiation of broad spectrum antibiotics on day six of hospital stay. Antibiotics were tapered to amoxicillin/clavulanate as soon as multi-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in blood cultures, and were continued for a total of two weeks. Sedation with fentanyl and midazolam were used initially, the latter replaced for propofol after resolution of distributive shock, and was administered for additional eight days. Delirium and agitation as well as unilateral paralysis of vocal cords hampered weaning from mechanical ventilation. Non-invasive ventilation, quetiapine (up to 800mg per day) and alprazolam (up to 16mg per day) were employed with successful extubation on the fifteenth day of hospital stay. Acute liver injury with a cholestatic pattern was probably multifactorial in its genesis and improved throughout the inicial days of hospitalization. Renal function and urine output were normal throughout intensive care stay and no imaging study was carried out. Clinical stability enabled the transfer to an internal medicine ward on day seventeenth day of hospital stay.
On admission to the internal medicine ward she was alert, with a depressed mood, nodding yes or no to all questions. Her vital signs were stable, and her blood work was unremarkable apart from minor cholestasis (in a decreasing trend) and a stable normochromic normocytic anaemia with normal creatinine and urea levels.
On the 21st day of hospitalization, the on-call physician was called due to patients agitation. Physical examination was unremarkable. Anuria had evolved over the last 16 hours and a urinary catheter was put in place with 200cc of fresh red blood coming out. Emergency blood work showed acute kidney injury with creatinine level of 5.76 mg/dL (normal range 0.51-0.95) and urea of 125 mg/dL (normal range 10-50). Reno-pelvic ultrasound showed mild bilateral uretero-hydronephrosis. Computed tomography revealed mild bilateral hydronephrosis with hyperdense foci in the pelvicaliceal system suggesting haemorrhagic content. After intravenous contrast administration, excretory phase CT depicted multiple filling defects in the left renal collecting system which in this clinical context were suggestive of sloughed papillae due to papillary necrosis (Fig. 1).
The patient underwent a cystoscopy, with hematic urine and small clots being visualized in the bladder. Retrograde pyelography showed bilateral pelvicalyceal and ureteral dilatation, as well as filling defects in the pelvicalyceal system. Continued postoperative ureteric drainage was ensured by the insertion of bilateral double-J stents. Postoperatively, the patient became polyuric during the first 48 hours but normalization of urine output and renal functions occurred after 4 days. Urinary and blood cultures were negative. Posterior follow-up revealed normal renal function, and elective removal of the double-J stents was performed 4 weeks later.

"Clinical cases
We evaluated retrospectively (2012-2018) six schizophrenia patients of Centro Hospitalar Conde de Ferreira (CHCF), with neuroleptic-induced ischemic colitis. All the patients have schizophrenia, two of them with intellectual disability associated. Excepting P3, all are male adults. To achieve adequate disease control all had antipsychotic drug associations. The most frequent were clozapine (five patients) and haloperidol (four patients). Five were also medicated with biperiden. None of the patients had risk for thrombotic or embolic arterial occlusion, previous abdominal surgery or cardiovascular comorbidities. Clinical and therapeutic details are detailed in table 1. The spectrum of clinical presentation was wide - we point out the depressed level of consciousness and the absence of typical clinical presentation of ischemic colitis in most of them. All were referred to emergency care but the aetiological investigation was also wide  five done a CT angiography, two a colonoscopy and one an exploratory laparotomy. All the patients had endoluminal occlusion with fecal impaction and the CT angiography excluded primary vascular disease. The two patients with shock were submitted to surgery (colectomy) and vasopressor support in intensive care unit. The other patients had conservative care (fecal extraction, parenteral antibiotics and laxatives). After discharge to our hospital, it was possible to reduce the dosage of the antipsychotic drugs in two patients. All started prophylactic laxatives. None of them had recurrence of the disease, but P1 had one episode of intestinal obstruction due to surgery adhesions. He later died of an event not related to the colitis.

"Case Description
33-year-old woman, with history of smoking and multiple dental cavities and infections, who experienced, for several weeks, odontalgia and progressive mouth opening restriction. She went to the emergency room of her hospital and was discharged with prescription of antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavunalate).
As the symptoms worsened, she returned to the emergency room three days later, where she presented severe trismus (< 1 cm of mouth opening), swelling and hyperemia of buccal mucosa and floor of mouth (worsened on left side), with no signs of tonsillitis, painful swelling of submental, left submandibular and left anterior cervical areas.
Methods and Procedures
She had elevated inflammatory parameters: leukocytosis 14,600/mm3 with neutrophilia 92.3%, and C-reactive protein 377 mg/L (<5 mg/L), and also mild thrombocytopenia (128,000/uL). Cervical computed tomography (CT) showed multiple communicating facial and cervical abscesses, namely on bilateral sublingual, submandibular and submental, right pterigomandigular, left lateropharingeal, and retropharyngeal spaces. No collections on the mediastinum were observed at this point.
She was transferred to our tertiary hospital for Maxillofacial Surgery care, where she underwent urgent surgery (bilateral drainage of the pterigomandibular, submental, sublingual, laterapharingeal and retropharyngeal spaces), maintained the nasotracheal tube for airway protection (she was not dependent of mechanical ventilation), and was then admitted to ICU, where she continued amoxicillin/clavulanate (2200 mg q8h).
Three days after surgery, she was clinically stable but the new image evaluation documented persistence of an extensive retropharyngeal abscess communicating with submandibular and vascular spaces, additionally associated with a thrombus of the left jugular vein (Figs 1, 2 and 3). At this point, extension to the posterior mediastinum and bilateral pleural effusion was also observed (Figs 4 and 5).
She underwent a second urgent procedure with combined approaches from Maxillofacial and Thoracic Surgery teams, for surgical drainage of the infected areas: revision drainage of left lateropharingeal, retropharingeal and bilateral pterygomandibular spaces, and drainage of the right submasseteric space; bilateral thoracic drainage of abundant purulent collections, extending to the posterior mediastinum and retroesophageal space from the apex to thediaphragm.
Specimens from the cervical and thoracic collections were both sent for microbiologic analysis.
The microbiological samples isolated beta-lactamase positive Prevotella denticola on both cervical and pleural effusion samples and Streptococcus constellatus on hemoculture and pleural effusion.
Infective serologies, including HIV, were negative.
The antibiotics were changed to piperacillin/tazobactam and clindamycin accordingly to antibiotic susceptibility test and also synergic effect.
Because of thrombosis of jugular vein, although of septic etiology, she was started on enoxaparin on therapeutic dosis, due to its extension.
She spent 16 days on ICU and was extubated on 15thday. Total in-hospital stay duration was 36 days.
Antibiotics were maintained for a total of 32 days, with clinical, analytical and radiological improvement. The left jugular vein remained collapsed and, after consulting with Vascular Surgery, it was decided to maintain anticoagulation for three months until repeated cervical Doppler ultrasound evaluation.
After hospital discharge, she was referred to the Oral Medicine department for completion of oral cavity treatment and rehabilitation.
She abandoned, by her choice, our clinical follow-up.
Discussion"
"Clinical case
We present the case of a 62 years-old, caucasian, female patient, with a diagnosis of SLE for over 32 years (six clinical  oral ulcers, joint envolvment (small articulations of the hands and wrists), leukopenia, mild thrombocytopenia, subacute cutaneous lupus and fever),and four immunologic criteria of the ACR  positive Anti-dsDNA, low C3 and C4, positive anticardiolipin antibodies and antibodies to beta-2-glycoprotein-I).
Three years after she was diagnosed she developed secondary severe thrombocytopenia (about 50 109/L) with a good initial improvement with oral corticosteroids (1mg/Kg/day). However, after 2-3 months, it relapsed upon the corticosteroids weaning. Thereafter, azathioprine (150mg/day), intravenous cyclophosphamide (750mg/month) and cyclosporine (4mg/Kg/day) were attempted, but discontinued due to leucopenia, gastrointestinal intolerance and hypertension, respectively.
After an unsuccessful danazol (600mg/day) trial, improvement was achieved with splenectomy and IVIg (0,4g/Kg/day during 5 days, every 4 weeks), followed by quarterly IVIg as maintenance treatment.
Seventeen years after the initial treatment with IVIg (April 2010), this treatment was discontinued due to a non ST elevation acute coronary syndrome during the treatment.
Seven months after this episode, she was started on rituximab (1g, days 1 and 15) due to recurrent and severe thrombocytopenia (5 109/L platelets). Four months later (March 2011) a second cycle was performed, but only with mild and transitory response (Fig. 1). Thus, in June 2011 romiplostim (SC injection, 1µg/Kg/week, total 50ug/week) was tried, with a stepwise dose increase to 150µg/week.
During 8 months a stable rise on platelet count to 100x109/L was obtained. Then, platelet count dropped again and an increase in steroids and a third cycle with rituximab (at May 2012) was attempted, without significant improvement.
On June 2012, severe thrombocytopenia installed again with counts around 30X109/L, having the patient multiple spontaneous ecchymosis, gum bleeding, epistaxis and bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage. Increasing romiplostim dose to 200µg/week improved platelet count to 150-200x109/L. Therapy with romiplostim was then gradually discontinued due to frequent diarrhea and severe weight loss. After 2013 and up until 2021 the patient maintained stable platelet counts > 100x109/L.

"Case report
A 57-year-old-man with a relevant medical history of smoking (smoking load of 45 pack-year) and left nephrectomy after kidney neoplasia seven years ago (stable by now) was admitted to the emergency department with a 4-day history of pleuritic chest pain that improved with anti-inflammatory medication. There had been an episode of a flu-like syndrome in the previous month with spontaneous resolution. He reported no fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. Also, there was no history of animal contact, recent travels, new medication, or exposure to dusty environmental conditions.
At the admission, he was hemodynamically stable, apyretic, with no alterations at auscultation, peripheral oxygen saturation (room air) of 92%, and no adenopathies were found. Laboratory testing showed leucocytosis (14.99x10^3/𝜇l; normal range 4,00-11,00 x 103/𝜇L) and increased C-reactive protein (50 mg/L; normal range 0-5 mg/L). The chest radiography presented a nodular infiltration in the right lower lobe subsequently clarified by CT scan showing a pulmonary mass in the periphery of the laterobasal segment of the right lower lobe measuring 50x38mm of largest transverse axes.
During hospitalization, he developed a cough with hemoptoic sputum and persisted with pleuritic chest pain. Autoimmune tests, including anti-neutrophil antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and rheumatoid factor (RF) were negative. Arterial blood gases, hepatorenal function, and electrolytes were in a normal range. There was no evidence of infection. An abdominal and pelvic tomography was performed showing a hepatic hemangioma with no other masses or lymphadenopathies. The bone scintigraphy showed findings compatible with degenerative bone disease. Since the pulmonary mass was peripheral, a transthoracic lung biopsy was performed.
Histopathologic examination of the pulmonary parenchyma revealed mild or moderate septal enlargement by edema, accompanied by lymphocyte infiltration and neutrophil polymorphonuclear cells, and alveolar spaces filled with fibrinoid material (fibrin balls) with some neutrophils (Fig. 1). These findings were compatible with acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia.
A revaluation chest tomography was performed one month after discharge, and there was a significant reduction of the mass, measuring 30x17mm. After four months, the lesion completely disappeared, persisting only small residual atelectasis (Fig. 2). The patient had a total follow-up of 15 months, with no recurrence of symptoms or imaging findings.
No targeted therapy was administered during hospitalization or after discharge since the patient evolved with spontaneous remission.

"Case description
A 77-year-old caucasian man was admitted in the intermediate care unit with a 4-day history of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever and dyspepsia. He had a history of valvular heart disease (with an aortic biological valve prosthesis), atrial fibrillation, essential hypertension, dyslipidemia and asthma. He had previously been evaluated in the emergency department 2 days after the onset of the symptoms. An upper respiratory viral infection was diagnosed, and he was discharged with symptomatic therapy. Due to the persistence of the symptomatology, aggravated with fever, he returned to the emergency department. Upon physical examination, the patient had a pulse of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure 98/58 mmHg, SpO2 93 % on air and an auricular temperature of 39,5° C. Pulmonary auscultation evidenced stertors on the right lung base. Abdominal palpation revealed a pain located on the right hypochondrium and epigastrium that worsened with decompression. His laboratory results showed a raised white blood cell count (17,8 × 103/mL with neutrophilia; reference range: 4  11 × 103/mL), thrombocytopenia (platelets 126x103/ml; reference range: 130  450 × 103/mL), an elevated creatinine concentration (1,53 mg/dL; reference range: 0,4  1,2 mg/dL) and an increased C-reactive protein concentration (41,36 g/dL; reference range: 0,020,75mg/dL). Other measurements were found within the expected ranges. Arterial blood gas analysis in room air revealed pH 7,53, paCO230 mmHg, paO2 59 mmHg, HCO3- 25,1 mmol/L, lactate 1,7 mmol/L; Sat.O2 93%. The chest X-ray showed opacity in the right lung base (Figure 1) and the search for both pneumococcal and legionella urine antigens was negative. An abdominal ultrasound was performed and evidenced hepatomegaly. At this point the patient presented clinical and analytical criteria for the diagnosis of sepsis with a starting point in a community-acquired pneumonia with multiple organ failure (respiratory and renal). Samples were collected for blood cultures, ceftriaxone and azithromycin were empirically initiated and the patient was admitted in the intermediate care unit. After 24 hours of treatment, given the persistence of fever and the worsening of the respiratory symptoms, a thoraco-abdominal computed tomography scan was performed. The exam revealed signs suggestive of pneumomediastinum below the level of the carina, with poor definition of the esophagus at this level, a densification in the right base of a probable inflammatory nature and a bilateral pleural effusion (Figures 2 and 3). After reviewing the clinical history, the patient reported that it had all started after swallowing a small chicken bone and choking on it, being left with the feeling of a bloated stomach. Since then, he had had an aggravation of epigastric discomfort and, progressively, the installation of respiratory symptoms. An endoscopic assessment revealed esophageal perforation, which was closed with clips. An esophageal transit and computed tomography scan with oral contrast was made, which did not reveal leakage and showed favorable imaging evolution. The patient completed 20 days of empiric antibiotherapy with piperacillin tazobactam, which was changed to vancomycin after the identification of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the blood cultures. He was discharged 40 days after admission with a complete symptom resolution.

"CASE PRESENTATION
A 40-year-old woman with a background history of Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy with kidney involvement currently on hemodyalisis, heart involvement carrying a pacemaker and submitted to liver transplantation in 2016, therefore taking tacrolimus 5 mg on a daily basis. Her medications also included ursodeoxycholic acid, pantoprazole, aspirin, sertraline, trazodone and oxazepam. She has history of iodinated contrast allergy. The patient was admitted to the emergency department with headaches and vomiting following hemodialysis session by central venous catheter. On physical examination she was lethargic, dehydrated, afebrile, blood pressure was 160/104mmHg and she had generalized tonic-clonic seizures while waiting for observation, that responded well to endovenous diazepam. No other remarkable points. Head CT scan was performed and showed subcortical bilateral hypodensities in a parieto-occipital dominance but also frontal and corona radiata lesions, without hemorrhage (figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not performed because the patient had a pacemaker and serial CT scans (figure 2) showed more defined lesions supporting the diagnosis.
During hospital stay symptoms were successfully controlled with labetalol and tacrolimus was replaced for mycophenolate mofetil resulting in a progressive full clinical recovery with no recurrence of PRES in the follow-up period.

"Case report
A 34-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to our Autoimmune Diseases Outpatient Clinic in 2006, due to total occlusion of both common carotid arteries.
Her past medical history included a viral myocarditis when she was 20 years old, and she had a eutocic delivery after a full-term uncomplicated pregnancy at the age of 27. The only data regarding the cardiac pathology that weve had access to are from the time of this birth  reference is made to a viral myocarditis that evolved to dilated cardiomyopathy, with the echocardiogram showing mild compromise of the left ventricular systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation. She was medicated with ramipril 5mg/d and clinically was in New York Heart Association functional class II.
At the age of 32, after a hospitalization because of abdominal pain and diarrhea, she was diagnosed with CD and was discharged on mesalazine 3g/d. Two months later, on a follow-up visit, prednisolone 20mg/d was added due to absent control of disease activity (Crohn's Disease Activity Index  CDAI=236) and evidence of a small bowel fistula. She was re-admitted 7 months later with several abscesses adjacent to the last ileal loop, and was submitted to an ileo-ceco-colonic resection. The histological examination of the surgical piece was consistent with the diagnosis of CD. In the months that followed the surgical procedure she remained clinically stable (CDAI=28), medicated with mesalazine 3g/d, and no complications were listed. Two years after the diagnosis of CD, in a routine visit, and being asymptomatic, a systolic bruit was identified over her right cervical area. The doppler ultrasound revealed total occlusion of both common carotid arteries and a normal calibre right vertebral artery with an accentuated elevation of its systolic peak velocity, of compensatory nature, and related to the audible bruit. She was therefore sent to our Clinic and after a thorough clinical questionnaire it was possible to identify the onset of left arm claudication more than 10 years earlier, which she disregarded, and occasional episodes of dizziness associated with prolonged periods of head extension. At physical examination, we noticed the absence of left brachial pulse and a difference of more than 30 mmHg in systolic blood pressure between arms (left: 101/48 mmHg; right: 133/83 mmHg). A pan-aortography was performed showing: 1) total occlusion of both common carotid arteries; 2) occlusion of the left subclavian artery at its origin; 3) concentric stenosis (of 50%) of the brachiocephalic trunk; 4) overdeveloped right vertebral artery, being the only source of brain irrigation; 5) no significant injuries in the thoracic aorta; 6) occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery; 7) occlusion of the right renal artery. Echocardiogram revealed normal-sized cardiac cavities with preserved global systolic function and mild mitral insufficiency, and cardiac catheterization showed no evidence of coronary injuries. Laboratory tests were unremarkable: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) within normal range; normal renal function and urinalysis; negative autoimmunity (ANA, ANCA, SSA, SSB, RNP, Sm, dsDNA, anticardiolipin, lupic anticoagulant). We established the diagnosis of TA, according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 classification criteria (table 1), with angiographic distribution type V (figure 1), and started her on prednisolone 1 mg/Kg/d (subsequently reduced to 10 mg on alternate days), methotrexate 10 mg/week and acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/d.
In the 5 years that followed the patient remained asymptomatic, in clinical and colonoscopic remission, with no evidence of ischemic events and the routine magnetic resonance angiographies did not reveal vascular injuries apart from those described initially, nor additional thickenings of the arterial walls suggestive of active vasculitic process. However, in October 2011 she started complaining of inflammatory back pain and bilateral pain in the buttocks with morning stiffness of about 60 minutes. Schober test was positive (limitation of lumbar flexion) and so was Patrick sign bilaterally. Laboratory tests showed an increase in acute-phase proteins (ESR=24 mm, CRP=12.0 mg/dL) and MRI revealed bilateral sacroiliitis. In the colonoscopy there was no evidence of CD relapse. Facing up this new finding, we chose to associate adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks to methotrexate, which resulted in the control of articular complaints. To this day, we did not ascertain any complication correlated to anti-TNFα therapy and she remains in remission both from TA and CD (CDAI=16).

"Clinical Case
A sixty-three-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure due to community-acquired pneumonia.
Two months earlier, he had been diagnosed with diffuse systemic sclerosis and secondary Sjögren syndrome. He presented with xerostomia, xerophthalmia, Raynaud phenomenon, dyspnea and gastroesophageal reflux symptoms one year before hospitalization. Significant findings on physical exam included skin thickening proximal to the metacarpal and metatarsophalangeal joints and upper trunk (Rodnan skin score: 36), puffy fingers and sclerodactyly. Immunologic workup revealed ANA 1/80 speckled pattern (normal <1/80) and Anti SS-A (Ro) antibody: 67,90 U/mL (normal: 0-15). Salivary gland scintigraphy reported moderate dysfunction of the parotid glands. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed reflux esophagitis and erosive gastropathy. High resolution computed tomography scan and pulmonary biopsy were compatible with usual interstitial pneumonia.
In the first days of hospitalization he was not improving, despite adequate antibiotic coverage.
On the 6th day, he complained of blurred vision and began topic treatment for a vitritis, after an ophthalmology consult. Next day, he presented with reversible cyanosis of all fingers of the right foot. He was observed by a vascular surgeon and started anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin. Two days later, he developed severe cardiorespiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation for 10 days.
On admission to the intensive care unit, transthoracic echocardiography displayed signs of acute heart failure with severe depression of left ventricular systolic function, compatible with stress cardiomyopathy. Pulmonary thromboembolism was excluded by thoracic angio-computed tomography.
He evolved with necrosis of the distal phalanges of all fingers except the 4th finger of the right hand (fig. 1) and bilateral amaurosis with ocular alterations compatible with acute retinal ischemia.
He was treated with iloprost perfusion for 10 days and non-fractionated heparin for 7 days, then changed to low molecular weight heparin 1 mg/Kg every 12 hours. Acetylsalicylic acid, pentoxifylline, calcium channels blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor were also prescribed.
Clinical progress was favourable. He still experienced several episodes of acute pulmonary edema with good response to endovenous nitrates. Coronary catheterism, performed while on anticoagulant therapy for several days, excluded ischemic etiology and transthoracic echocardiography revealed improvement in the systolic function of the left ventricle.
When stabilized, an amputation of distal phalanges of the left hand, first to third fingers of the right hand, transmetatarsic in the left foot and below the right knee was performed (fig. 2). The visual acuity was partially recovered.
The workup, before anticoagulation treatment, showed ANA 1/80 speckled pattern, anticardiolipin antibody: 116 MPL-U/mL (positive if > 40), anti-β2 glycoprotein antibodies: 76 U/mL (positive if > 10) and lupus anticoagulant with antiphospholipid characteristics. Similar results were obtained more than 12 weeks later, under low molecular weight heparin.

Other intercurrences during hospitalization included: Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis; dysphagia that conditioned incapability for oral alimentation till the sixtieth day of hospitalization, with videofluoroscopy revealing oesophageal abnormalities compatible with systemic sclerosis; myopathy and cachexia with slow but good response to physiotherapy.
The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation unit. after 94 days of hospitalization, on oral anticoagulation with warfarin for targeted INR levels between 2 and 3 and aspirin 100 mg/day.
After 6 months, he had complete healing of the stumps and was responding well to intensive physiotherapy. Nevertheless, and despite having INR values were within therapeutic range, he suffered a spontaneous extensive bleeding in the brain stem that led him to die.

"CASE REPORT
Male, 63 years old, was admitted after a suicidal attempt by hanging. According to his family, a year prior to admission, the patient started with a depressive mood, crying spells, anhedonia, increased sleep and anorexia. After a quarrel with his 90-year-old mother, he decided to commit suicide. He had no history of neurologic deficits, convulsions, syncope or trauma. Except for signs of malnourishment (Body Mass Index of 15.6 kg/m2), his physical examination was normal, and he showed no evidence of movement disorders (tremor, dystonia, ataxia, chorea, athetosis) or memory loss.
A cerebralcomputed tomography (CT) scan showed profound bilateral calcifications of thebasal ganglia (Figure 1).Complete blood count,C-reactiveprotein, lactic acid,renal and hepatic functions, total plasma parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorusand immunological panel(antinuclear antibodies; anti-DNA; anti-SM; antiphospholipid antibody) werenormal. Humanimmunodeficiency virus, Epstein-Barr virus and VDRL tests were negative.Urinary heavy metals dosages were within reference levels.Cerebral spinal fluid cellcount, glucose and proteins were normal and cultures were sterile. A moleculargenetic testing wasnt performed due to financial constraints. His familyhistory couldnt, also, be fully accessed for any pattern of inheritance: hisfather had died of cardiac arrest when the patient was 12 years old and therewerent any paternal relatives. His mother, two maternal uncles and threecousins had a normal clinical examination and cerebral CT scan. The patient hadno offspring.

He was treated with sertraline 100mg/day. There was a progressive improvement in his depressive complaints and no signs of suicidal ideology. He was discharged home, after 2 months-admission, with follow-up appointments scheduled with his psychiatrist.
DISCUSSION"
"Case presentation
A 69 year-old man with a history of arterial hypertension and sleep apnoea presented in the emergency department with dysesthesia, muscle weakness in the lower limbs and dysautonomia. The patient had been well until 4 weeks before admission when he noticed numbness and burning sensation in the feet with progression to the knees, later associated with urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, diarrhoea and hyperhidrosis and insomnia. Before admission, muscle weakness in the legs emerged.
On the emergency department the physical examination was normal except for mild and symmetrical paraparesis with fasciculation of all limbs, tongue and chest. Blood analysis showed 11.200 white blood cells per cubic millimeter, with 69% of neutrophils. No other alterations were detected. Cerebral and dorsal spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had no expansive lesions. Lumbar puncture excluded infection, neoplasm or the presence of autoantibodies. Electromyography of the upper and lower limbs revealed loss of motor units associated with multiple and spontaneous electrical discharges, compatible with myokymia. No alterations of the fibers, neurotransmission or neuromuscular junction were detected. An extensive search for autoantibodies was performed, with identification of Anti-CASPR2 and Anti-LGI1 on serum. These findings raised the possibility of Morvan Syndrome and due to its association with neoplasm a chest computed tomography (CT) was performed, identifying an anterior mediastinical mass (figure 1) that was later confirmed to be a thymoma by transthoracic biopsy.
The initial treatment was benzodiazepines, oral potassium, magnesium sulfate, Intravenous immunoglobulin(IV Ig)  0,4mg/kg/day for 5 days  later completed with thymectomy. Pathological examination of the specimen confirmed a B2 Stage Thymoma with free margins. Persistence of myokymia and the initiation of delirium (not attributable to other causes) led to plasmapheresis.
Neurologic recovery was initially observed but one month later the patient presented in the outpatient clinic with new clinical worsening  altered mental status with nocturnal delirium, insomnia, generalized myokymia and loss of the ability to walk. It was also identified, for the first time, atrial fibrillation. Once more was admitted on the clinical ward, where he initiated corticosteroids, plasmapheresis (4 sessions) and cyclophosphamide (0.5g every two weeks during 6 sessions). Due to refractory disease rituximab was attempted (375mg/m2 weekly, initially 4 weeks, completed with two more sessions two weeks after finishing the first treatment cycle). After the anti-CD20 therapy, B cell depletion and clinical remission were achieved. Anti-CASPR2 remained positive but Anti-LGI1 antibodies turned negative. Maintenance therapy with azathioprine was attempted for 6 months, interrupted after multiple infections.
One year after the first admission and diagnosis, clinical relapse occurred, with dysesthesia and hyperhidrosis. It had been 8 months after the last rituximab session and there had been repopulation of B cells. Anti-CASPR2 remained positive and total body CT showed a mass on the left kidney (1.8cm), compatible with renal cell carcinoma (figure 2). No other lesions were identified, namely on the mediastinum. Once more total clinical remission was achieved with the association of surgery (nephrectomy that confirmed the diagnosis) and immunomodulation (corticosteroids and rituximab  3 sessions of 1g each).
Four years after the initial diagnosis, the patient remains asymptomatic without steroids, with no new lesions albeit positivity to Anti-CASPR2 stills remains.

"CASE DESCRIPTION
A 65-years-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with acute progressive symmetric, ascending, flaccid, quadriparesis. Neurological manifestations began with acute weakness of distal lower extremities, four days prior to admission. It quickly progressed from distal to proximal limbs, culminating in quadriparesis two days before admission, and facial paresis bilaterally. He had no urinary or fecal incontinence, or sensitivity alterations. Since the previous day, the patient presented fever and myalgia, and feeling of fatigue.
Medical history included systemic hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and previous stroke with no sequelae.
On physical examination, the patient was febrile, hemodynamically stable, respiratory rate 20/minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The neurological examination showed normal consciousness and language, symmetric limb weakness with a Medical Research Council (MRC) scale 3/5 in proximal, 4/5 in distal of the upper extremities and 3/5 in proximal, 4/5 in distal of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were present on admission, but became absent after 2 days. Plantar response was normal. He presented bifacial nerve palsy, but had no sensitive alterations, signs of dysautonomia, meningeal signs or upper motor neuron disorder signs.
Analytical studies showed a slight increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) 6.19 mg/dL and LDH 291 UI/L, and were otherwise unremarkable. Arterial blood gases revealed hypoxia (paO2 61.8 mmHg without supplemental oxygen).
X-ray of the chest showed slight bilateral peripheric ground glass opacities.
Brain and cervical computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant alterations.Lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) had a mild increase in the protein content (50 mg/dL) and no cells were found, showing an albuminocytologic dissociation.
Nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.
The patient was hospitalized with the presumptive diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), concomitant to COVID-19 pneumonia. He received 0.40 g/kg/day intravenous Immunoglobulin for five days, with progressive improvement of muscle strength and resolution of facial palsy.
Further investigation identified no other infectious agent: CFS and blood cultures were negative, as were serologies for syphilis, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Borrelia burgdorferii, herpes simplex, antigenuria for Legionella and Streptococcus pneumoniae. He was immune to hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus.
On day 11, neurophysiological study was performed with electromyography (EMG), showing slight signs of distal and proximal dysfunction of the cubital right nerve, and proximal dysfunction of the posterior tibial right nerve.
In regard to SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia, the patient was treated with oxygen therapy, dexamethasone 6mg/day, for 10 days, but after 6 days, severe type 1 respiratory failure developed, requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with continuous positive airway pressure ventilation. A lung CT was performed and revealed peripheric diffused consolidations and ground-glass opacities in both lungs. Treatment with Remdesivir was started (initial dose of 200 mg, followed by 100 mg/day, for 4 days), according to practice guidelines at the time. The patient showed improvement in respiratory insufficiency, being able to suspend NIV after 6 days, and he had no need of further oxygen 2 days later.
He was discharged after 2 weeks of hospitalization, with follow up in Neurology consultation, showing significant improvement of neurological symptoms  muscle strength of 5/5 in MRC scale in all segments, except for lower right limb, which showed 4/5, and no facial palsy.
DISCUSSION"
"Case Presentation
An 80-year-old male was transferred to our hospital on 12/01/2021 with fever, shortness of breath, confusion, diarrhea and vomiting with uncertain onset, who had tested positive for SARS-CoV2 on 05/01/2021. The patient had a history of ischemic heart disease with preserved ejection fraction and controlled hypertension; was a non-smoker, and had no previous history of pulmonary or congenital heart disease.
On admission to our ward, the patient was apyretic and disoriented. His blood pressure was 136/64 mmHg and his pulse rate was 82 bpm. His oxygen saturation was 96% with supplemental oxygen (2 L/min through nasal cannula). Respiratory examination showed tachypnea, but with no use of accessory muscles of respiration, chest expansion was symmetrical. There were wheezes in the medium third of the right hemithorax and crackles in the right pulmonary base. The remaining systemic examination was within normal limits, including the cardiovascular system. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air confirmed type 1 respiratory failure (pH 7.51; PaO2 60 mmHg; paCO2 26 mmHg, R P/F 288). Complete blood count showed leukocytosis (11200/ul) and mild lymphopenia (750/ul), with C-reactive protein elevation (62 mg/dL). Serum creatinine was within normal limits. The liver panel showed slight cytolysis (AST 95 U/L and ALT 95 U/L). There was severe hyponatremia (serum Na+ 102mmol/L), due to thiazide use (usual medication of the patient) in association with the gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea). His Pro-BNP levels were 480 pg/mL.
The patient was managed as a case of severe COVID-19 disease, as per protocol (supplemental oxygen therapy, steroids, anticoagulation, self-prone and early kinesiotherapy). Adequate correction of hyponatremia was achieved through fluid therapy and withdrawal of causative drugs.
On the 12th day of illness, there was a deterioration of respiratory failure, with the need to escalate oxygen therapy to high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation. A chest CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism, but showed bilateral diffuse peripheral ground-glass opacity, coexisting with interstitial consolidation in lower zones. (Fig. 1). There were no signs of fluid overload or bacterial infection. Because of the persistence of respiratory failure, the chest CT angiogram was repeated on the 21st day of illness, showing fibrotic evolution and organizing appearance, suggesting complication with organizing pneumonia (Fig. 2). On the 30th day of illness, and the 23rd day of high-dose steroid therapy (1mg/kg of prednisolone), there was only a slight clinical improvement; it was then, with further patient mobilization that it was noticed that his hypoxemia was more profound while he was standing or sitting (with the need to escalate from nasal cannula (estimated FiO2 31%) up to high flow oxygen mask (estimated FiO2 80%)), and improved when he laid down. His saturation decreased from 96% in the recumbent position to 88% in orthostasis.
Since cardiac-related POS is the most reported etiology, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with bubble contrast with intravenous agitated saline was performed. The study showed normal-sized chambers, no significant valvular heart disease, inferior vena cava caliber in the upper normal limit (21mm). Pulmonary arterial flux suggested pulmonary hypertension (it was not possible to estimate pulmonary systolic arterial pressure) and a significant right-to-left shunt through a presumed PFO was found - the appearance of bubbles in the left atrium within 3 cardiac cycles suggesting an intracardiac shunt. (Fig. 3)7,8
Therefore, the diagnosis of POS with intracardiac shunt was made. It was assumed extensive post-COVID-19 organizing pneumonia, precipitated pulmonary hypertension and reversion of shunt from left-to-right to right-to-left (elevated right atrial pressure).
The definitive treatment of POS due to intracardiac shunt usually requires repair of the cardiac anomaly. However, the functional defects must also be approached by correcting the underlying etiology. After discussion with Cardiology, it was decided that the timing was not ideal to correct the primary cardiac abnormality, and a watchful waiting approach was instituted: waiting for the resolution of interstitial damage and consequently, pulmonary hypertension. Under corticosteroids and physiotherapy, platypnea-orthodeoxia improved by day 45 of illness. On discharge, the patient denied dyspnea and his PaO2 was 69.6mmHg on room air and orthostatic position. The patient was discharged on steroid weaning and with indication to maintain physical rehabilitation.

"CASE REPORT
A 53-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with a 1-month history of asthenia, loss of appetite and painful erythematous-violaceous nodules on the extremities, as well as swelling of the knees and ankles, without heat or erythema. No fever was documented. Otherwise, the results of a review of the systems were normal. And she had no significant medication history changes recently.
At physical examination she looked well and was afebrile. No one of the nodules were ulcerated or were dreaining oily fluid, but she referred occasionally spontaneous yellowish liquid by some of them.
Her medical history include idiopathic chronic pancreatitis diagnosed over 15 years ago with several episodes of exacerbation and complications mainly in form of pancreatic cysts operated on several occasions; in control in our hospital, with clinical stability in recent months.
In the presence of painful subcutaneous nodules we considered the following diagnostic hypotheses: erythema nodosum, erythema induratum Bazin, SLE, sarcoidosis, cutaneous metastases, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, polyarteritis nodosa, panniculitis-like subcutaneous lymphomas and infectious and traumatic origin. With the help of diagnostic tests that we report below and taking into account the medical history of the patient and the clinical and epidemiological manifestations, we could establish the diagnosis of pancreatic panniculitis origin.
Laboratory tests showed significant elevation serum amylase and lipase, a hemoglobin level of 8.3 with normal mean corpuscular volume, a white blood cell count of 3.68×109/L without eosinophilia and elevated acute reactant phase. The liver profile showed mild elevated serum transaminases, as usual in our patient for years. The remaining parameters, including renal function, inmunology, Mantoux, alpha-1-antitrypsin, angiotensin-converting enzyme or tumor marker, were within the normal range. Serologies as Mycoplasma, Yersinia, Chlamydia or Treponema were negatives. And blood cultures and nodular material cultures were also negatives.
The chest radiograph was normal and abdominal CT scan revealed the persistence of old scars in pancreas without evidence of exacerbation at the time.
Suspecting skin involvement in the context of her long pancreatic disease, a nodule biopsy was done to confirm the clinical diagnosis of panniculitis. Skin histopathlogy was pathognomonic: lobular panniculitis without vasculitis, with focal necrosis in adipocytes associated with Â´ghost-like cellsÂ´ with microcalcifications inside and without vasculitis. Her study was completed by performing bone gammagraphy and bone marrow biopsy without evidence of extension or involvement of the fatty tissues; that fact have substantially poor prognosis. Symptomatic treatment was started with analgesics, rest and elevation of the extremities. The most of the skin lesions resolved spontaneuosly after 10 days and pancreatic enzymes returned to normal.


DISCUSSION"
"CASE DESCRIPTION:
31 years old, previously healthy, Caucasian woman, working has a nurse, was submitted to an elective cesarean due to an Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, at 38 weeks of pregnancy time. Cesarean was complicated by uterine hemorrhage, with hemodynamic instability, so a total hysterectomy had to be performed. It was her first pregnancy. At the immediate postoperative period, the patient developed acute renal failure (needing RRT), high blood pressure (BP: 157/84mmHg, with normal fundoscopic examination), thrombocytopenia (96.000 x10^9/L platelets) and anemia (Hb 7,0g/dL) with <1% of schistocytes in the blood smear. No other clinical changes were present, fever was never noted and the neurologic exam was always normal. On the following day, anemia persisted in spite of blood transfusion (Hb 6,0 g/dL) and hemolytic non-immune criteria emerged (LDH 434U/L, Total bilirubin: 3.0mg/dL, Haptoglobin < 10mg/dL, Coombs negative), with progressive raise of schistocytes to 4% and a minimum thrombocytopenia of 26.000 x10^9/L. Anuria was noted, with maximum Creatinine value 4,42 mg/dL and Urea 221 mg/dL, and the urinary analysis presented proteinuria in a non-nephrotic range (0.8-2 g/L) and hematuria.
The patient had no extra-renal manifestations, such as neurologic symptoms. At this time, suspecting of a thrombotic microangiopathy, without an established etiology, plasmapheresis every two days and 1g of methylprednisolone per day for 5 days followed by 1mg/Kg/day of prednisolone were started, with very slight improvement. However, the patient remained with renal failure under RRT and persisting hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.
To clarify the etiology of this thrombotic microangiopathy, numerous biochemical, immunological and genetic tests were performed (see Table 1. for further detail).
Considering the diagnosis of TMa, the following hypothesis appeared: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (Shiga toxin associated or atypical) or secondary TMa.
Secondary TMa:As the patient was a puerperal woman, the most probable hypothesis was a pregnancy related TMa. Although no hypertension and proteinuria were noted during pregnancy, the patient was hypertensive and had proteinuria at the immediate post-partum. Yet, arterial blood pressure was not severely elevated (Systolic BP<160mmHg) and was easily controlled with low dose of nifedipine. Even though preeclampsia could not be totally excluded, the benign course of blood pressure values made us consider that preeclampsia would not likely be the cause for the TMa etiology. HELLP syndrome was not a hypothesis once liver enzymes were normal.
Autoimmune disease, such as primary or secondary Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome (APS) or Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE), were excluded considering that: Lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin, anti-glycoprotein, ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies were negative; malignant hypertension was not present; infections like HIV or Hepatitis C were also excluded with negative serology. Puerperal sepsis was also excluded by maintained apyrexia, absence of elevated acute phase reagents, no clinical signs or symptoms of infection, and negative blood and urine cultures. Neoplasms were unlikely since the patient had no symptoms supporting that option. Drug associated TMa was not considered because the patient was not taking any suspicious drug (e.g. quinine, calcineurin inhibitors, oxymorphone) before or after delivery.
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura:Although neurologic manifestations were not present and renal failure was the major organ manifestation, TTP had to be excluded. So, ADAMTS13 was essential to the differential diagnosis and the results were not concordant with this hypothesis.
Typical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome:Even though the patient lacked gastrointestinal symptoms, Shiga toxin was searched and negative.
Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome:The genetic study showed homozygotic deletion of the CFHR1-CFHR3 gene; this deletion is described as being associated with the development of anti-complement H factor antibody, which is confirmed in this case by high values (30,41 UA/mL).12
Hence, immediately after the diagnosis confirmation and exclusion of other possible causes, eculizumab was started on day 15 from disease presentation (900mg intravenous once a week for four weeks, followed by 1200mg every fifteen days for an undetermined time). This treatment allowed progressive improvement of the renal function, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Meanwhile, anti-pneumococci, anti-meningococci and anti-Hemophilus vaccines were given.
After starting eculizumab, RRT was no longer needed, renal function recovered slowly and the patient was discharged at the 25th day, during the induction phase of the treatment (two weeks of treatment with eculizumab 900mg weekly). At discharge, the patient had the following laboratory test results: Hb 8.7g/dL, platelets 141.000x10^9/L, Urea 89mg/dL, Creatinine 1.75mg/dL, albuminuria 24h 1828mg/24h, GFR (measured) 44ml/min/1.73m2.
During follow-up, recovery was documented (see table 2) and the patient kept treatment with eculizumab 1200mg every fifteen days and antibiotic prophylaxis against capsulated agents with amoxicillin 500mg bid.

"CASE DESCRIPTION
A 34-year-old Chinese pregnant woman (26 weeks gestation) presented to the Emergency Department with acute epigastric pain. Previous pregnancy with C-section at 32 weeks gestation, which she said was caused by excess fat in the blood. She had no follow-up since then and was on no medication.
On admission she had abdominal tenderness in the upper quadrants. The lab results are in Table 1. We highlight serum lipase 1786 U/L and serum triglyceride (TG) 5036 mg/dL (Fig.s 1 and 2). The abdominal ultrasound showed pancreatic oedema and peri-pancreatic effusion.
She was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU), hemodynamically stable, and started centrifugal TPE, considering extremely elevated levels of TG, gestational age, presence of a serious complication, risk of pre-term labour and risk of foetal and maternal death. Each TPE session lasted 119 to 221 minutes. The volume corresponded to 1 ± 0.27 plasma volume, requiring 7 to 12 cycles. She became asymptomatic once TG were controlled (500-700 mg/dl) and experienced transient tachycardia and hypotension during treatment. She started low lipid diet and omega-3 supplementation. Foetal ultrasound revealed a foetus (1109g) with good vitality and growth.
Since TG raised after each plasmapheresis, after reviewing the literature, it was decided to start 200mg fenofibrate per day.
On day 9 (27 weeks + 2 days), she complained of newly onset abdominal pain. Obstetric re-evaluation was normal. A new abdominal ultrasound revealed worsening of the peri-pancreatic effusion, and an MRI showed pancreatic necrosis (Fig.s 3 and 4).
The patient remained without fever, abdominal pain, or evidence of infection (negative blood cultures and low levels of c-reactive protein). Plasmapheresis was continued for 19 sessions (Figure 5), and subsequent abdominal ultrasounds showed no worsening.
At 31 weeks and 6 days gestation, after foetal lung maturation with betamethasone, she had an elective C-section and delivered a male sex new-born (1746g, Apgar score: 9/10/10).
Despite low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis during ICU stay, the patient developed a deep venous thrombosis associated to the TPE catheter and was started on anticoagulation with LMWH. Genetic thrombophilia study was negative.
She was discharged 11 days after delivery with follow-up in outpatient clinic of Endocrinology, Transfusion Medicine and Internal Medicine. After 9 months of fenofibrate therapy: TG 766mg/dL, total cholesterol 265mg/dL, HDL 31mg/dL, LDL 106mg/dL.
A genetic and molecular study for familiar dyslipidaemias revealed a heterozygotic mutation in LPL gene. As this doesnt justify the phenotype, the study of rare familial dyslipidaemias (monogenic causes) is still ongoing.

"CASE REPORT
A 41-year-old male was admitted with an acute weakness of the lower limbs and inability to walk for about 24 hours. He referred that, two weeks prior to admission, he had had 4 to 5 evacuations/day of watery stools that resolved in 3 days, without any medication. He denied other symptoms.
He had a history of arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and psoriatic arthritis. He was medicated with olmesartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5mg id; metformin 1000mg id; rosuvastatin 10mg id; methotrexate 10mg/week; omeprazol 20mg id.
Heterosexual intercourses with risk for HIV transmission were reported and he had been tested HIV-negative about six-months before.
On physical examination, he had symmetrical weakness of both proximal and distal muscles of the lower limbs (grade 3/5) and normal strength in the upper limbs. Cranial nerves were normal. There was hypotonia and absent reflexes in lower limbs with bilateral absent plantar reflex. There wasnt any sensory deficit. Bladder and bowel functions were intact. He hadnt respiratory insufficiency. Examination of other systems was irrelevant.
Blood tests showed a normal white blood cell count (WBC) and negative C-reactive protein. Cerebral and spinal computed tomography scans were unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed albuminocytological dissociation, proteins of 34mg/dL with pleocytosis and low glucose (Table 1). Electromyography showed severe axonal polyneuropathy. A presumptive diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome was made and the patient started on intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) at 400mg/kg/day for 5 days.
The aetiology investigation showed positive HIV-1 antibodies by ELISA test, later confirmed by Western blot.Plasma HIV-viral load was 141000 copies/mL (6.15log), CD4+T-cell count was 236 cells/mm3(24.8%), whereas CD8+T-cell count was 512 cells/mm3(54.0%), with CD4+/CD8+ratio of 0.46.Further blood analysis showed negativity for hepatitis B, C, E, syphilis,Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barrvirus,Herpes simplex1- 2 virus andToxoplasma gondii(Table 1).
CSF analysis revealed a HIV viral load of 113954 copies/mL.It was negative, by Polymerase Chain Reaction essay, for varicella zoster virus, enterovirus, adenovirus (Table 1).
There was no evidence ofSalmonellaspecies,Shigella,E.coliO157,CampylobacterorCryptosporidiumoocysts in faecal samples.
The patient started a fixed dose combination therapy with ABC/3TC/DTG and was discharged 23 days after admission with improved mobility but still requiring walking aids.
Six weeks after initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), he was re-evaluated in an outpatient setting. He was walking with a cane and was otherwise asymptomatic.CD4+T-cell count was 668 cells/mm3(28.7%) while plasma HIV-viral load had decreased drastically (Table 1).The patient maintains antiretroviral compliance, regular physiotherapy and outpatient clinical follow-up.

"CASE REPORT
A 68-year-old woman, with a past medical history significant only for type 2 diabetes mellitus, and no known drug allergy history, was admitted to the Internal Medicine ward with a soft tissue infection of the right foot. On the first day of hospitalization, empiric treatment was started with piperacillin-tazobactam and kept for seven days. On the sixth day, metamizole was initiated for pain control and, on the seventh day, risperidone and paroxetine were introduced due to psychomotor agitation and mood disorder.
On the ninth day of hospitalization, the patient suddenly developed a symmetric and bilateral generalized pruritic dermatosis (Fig. 1 and 2), characterized by hundreds of non-follicular pinhead-sized pustules on a widespread edematous and erythematous maculopapular exanthem initially affecting the trunk, spreading to the neck, upper limbs, and armpits a few hours later. Mucous membranes and skin appendages were not affected and no adenopathies were found.
Meanwhile, she developed fever (38ºC) and blood tests revealed leucocytosis (14.7 x 109/L) with neutrophilia (91.7%), and a normal eosinophil count (0.01 x 109/L). Renal function and liver tests were within the reference values. Acute infection due to Parvovirus B19, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus were excluded. Blood cultures were negative. The diagnostic hypothesis of a drug hypersensitivity reaction, manifested either as AGEP or Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), was considered, and the most likely involved drugs taken at that time, by temporal association, metamizole, risperidone and paroxetine, were suspended. We also considered pustular psoriasis as a differential diagnosis. Topical betamethasone, oral prednisolone, and oral H1 antihistamines were started. On the thirteenth day of hospitalization (4 days after the reactions onset), a 4 mm punch skin biopsy was performed intercepting one of the pustules. The patient presented with a good evolution, with progressive regression of the rash. Skin desquamation (Fig. 3) occurred four days after the exanthem started and complete lesion resolution took eleven days. The white cells count returned to baseline values after two days. Histological results (Fig. 4) showed an epidermis with extensive subcorneal pustules with papillary edema and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial, perivascular, and interstitial dermis, with lymphocytes, neutrophils, and some eosinophils, compatible with AGEP. In the meantime, due to clinical necessity, paroxetine was reintroduced under vigilance without any clinical reaction.
Two months after complete resolution of the adverse reaction, the etiological investigation was carried out with drug epicutaneous tests in petrolatum (piperacillin-tazobactam at a concentration of 10%, 20%, and 100%; metamizole at 10%, 20%, and 50%; risperidone at 10% and 20%). Readings at 48 hours, 72 hours, and on day 7 were negative. The patient was then advised to continue the investigation with intradermal tests with late readings and/or lymphocyte transformation test (LTT), which she refused and was then advised to avoid all beta-lactams, metamizole, and benzisoxazoles.

DISCUSSION"
"CASE DESCRIPTION
A 68-year-old man, with a medical history of essential hypertension, in use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, presented at the emergency room due to malaise, asthenia, somnolence and anorexia for the previous 2 days.
At admission he was vigil but lethargic, his blood pressure was 138/72 mmHg, heart rate 78 beats/min, body temperature of 36.4oC. He was pale, presented with hair weakening, mainly on his eyebrows, from which the external third was missing.
Blood chemistry revealed severe hyponatremia (108 mmol/L), normal potassium levels, a reduced serum osmolarity (220 mosmol/L), a normal renal function, serum glucose, triglycerides and unremarkable serum protein electrophoresis. It also showed a urine osmolarity <100 mosmol/L and a high urinary sodium.
Isotonic fluids were started with poor response. Hence hormonal investigation ensued, showing low levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, high levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and a very low free thyroxine (FT4), low growth hormone (GH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone and also a borderline low follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (table 1).

Hypopituitarism was hypothesized and a brain MRI was performed. An empty sella (with a flattened pituitary gland), without focal lesions was shown (figure 1).
On ultrasound the patient had a slightly enlarged and heterogeneous thyroid, with bilateral hypoechogenic nodules (the largest of which with 7.8 x 5.1 x .51mm).
These results led to secondary adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and presumable primary autoimmune hypothyroidism diagnosis. The patient was started on hormonal replacement therapy with prednisolone 5 mg/day and with levothyroxine 0.025 mg/day, changed to 0,075mg 4 days later. He was discharged at the 8thday with sodium levels of 128 mmol/L. His medication was switched to valsartan and amlodipine.
In the follow-up visit, 3 weeks latter, the patient was felling well but still with low stamina, described by the family as usual. He had normal sodium levels (135mmol/L). After obtaining normal levels of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and an unremarkable prostatic ultrasound, testosterone decanoate was also initiated (250 mg every 4 weeks). A month later the patient was symptom free (referring no somnolence or lethargy), and sodium levels were within the normal range (135 mmol/L), so prednisolone was titrated to 2.5 mg/day. One year later, due to a rise in PSA levels, testosterone decanoate was suspended. The patient remained asymptomatic medicated with prednisolone 2,5mg and levothyroxine 0,075mg.

DISCUSSION"
"Case report: A 71-year-old male patient was admitted to the Emergency Room due to a symptomatic first seizure. Medical history was unremarkable. He had no past history of epilepsy, neck radiation or thyroid surgery. Family history was irrelevant. Laboratory investigations revealed normal renal and thyroid function, hypocalcaemia of 6.2 mg/dL (normal range 8.4-9.7), hyperphosphatemia of 6.1 mg/dL (normal range 2.7-4.5), normal serum albumin of 4.2 g/dL (reference range 3.4-4.8), low 25-OH vitamin D levels of 50 nmol/L (normal range 62.5-200), normal magnesium of 1.57 (normal range 1.3-2.1), low calciuria of 16 mg/24h (normal range 100-320) and undetectable PTH <5.0 pg/mL (reference range 15.0-65.0). Computed tomography scan of the brain revealed multiple calcifications involving the basal ganglia (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Based on clinical, analytical and radiological findings, the patient was diagnosed with primary hypoparathyroidism and the diagnosis of FS was assumed.
Conclusion: We report a case of FS with basal ganglia calcification in a patient with primary hypoparathyroidism that first presented with seizures. Reduced PTH causes hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphatemia that promotes brain calcification4. Although rare, this syndrome should be suspected when symmetrical calcification of basal ganglia is seen. The most common reported metabolic disorders that cause FS are hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism4. If no cause for primary brain calcification is detected, the diagnosis of primary familial basal calcification should be considered and genetic testing is recommended4.

Clinical Case
A 71-year-old woman was admitted in the emergency service, in October 2016, complaining of fatigue and dry cough.
She had history of mellitus diabetes type 2 treated with oral antidiabetics and breast cancer.
The breast cancer was diagnosed 4 years earlier, in January 2012. She presented with a locally advanced lesion staged as cT3N+M0. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed HER2 overexpression (3+), estrogen receptor positive (90%) and progesterone receptor negative. She started neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ChT) with FEC-DH regimen (4 cycles of 5-fluorouracil (500mg/m2), epirubicin (100mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2) q21 days, followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel (75mg/m2) and trastuzumab (6mg/Kg). In August 2012, she performed a modified radical left mastectomy. Pathology evaluation presented ypT1cN3aG3R0. After surgery, she completed 1 year of trastuzumab alongside with adjuvant hormone therapy with anastrazol and adjuvant thoracic radiotherapy (RT) of regional lymph nodes. In October 2014, disease recurrence was diagnosed, with bone, lung and lymph node metastasis. Hormone treatment was changed to tamoxifen and trastuzumab was restarted. One year later, due to bone disease progression, she started letrozol and lapatinib. In August 2016, the patient complained about lower limb weakness. MRI of the spine showed a soft tissue mass in L5 with radicular compression. She was evaluated by a neurosurgeon and it was decided there was no surgical indication. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan showed lymph node enlargement in right pulmonary hilum and 3 micronodules in both lungs which were stable in relation to previous exams since 2015 (Fig. 1). Echocardiogram was unremarkable, presenting an ejection fraction of 61%. The patient underwent palliative L5-S1 radiotherapy and started on steroids (prednisolone 20mg/day). Seven weeks before admission, she was started on weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) (pretreatment with ranitidine 50 mg endovenous (EV), dexamethasone 8 mg EV and clemastine 2 mg EV) and trastuzumab (600 mg) subcutaneous q21 days.
She reported progressive fatigue and generalized muscular weakness on the fourth week of treatment. Her oncologist increased prednisolone to 30 mg/day. However, she continued getting worse and, in the few days before admission, she was not able to stand or walk without assistance. She had a dry cough, no thoracic pain and had not evaluate fever at home. She had a total of 7 weeks of treatment.
At admission, she was hypotensive (94/56 mmHg), tachycardic (113 bpm), with fever (auricular temperature: 38.1ºC), eupneic, with peripheral saturation in room air of 78%. She was oriented in time and space, had pale skin and mucous membranes and pulmonary auscultation revealed fine crackles in both lung bases. No other relevant alterations were observed.
Arterial blood gas analysis, on a FiO2 21%, showed: pH: 7.48; pCO2: 33.4; pO2: 51.6; SatO2: 87.8%; HCO3: 25.8; Lact: 1.1.
Blood analysis exhibited a normocytic normochromic anemia and reactive C protein elevation (Table 1).
Urianalysis had no signs of infection. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 109 bpm. Chest radiography revealed discrete bilateral infiltrates (Fig. 2). An angio-CT scan was executed to rule out pulmonary embolism and showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities, mosaic attenuation pattern and some linear densifications (Fig. 3).
She was admitted in an internal medicine ward. The case was discussed with her oncologist and a pneumonologist. She was treated with empiric antibiotics, 7 days of ceftriaxone and 3 days of azithromycin. Blood cultures were negative. The dose of corticoid treatment was initially increased: methylprednisolone, 62.5 mg/day for three days, then switched to oral prednisolone, 20 mg daily. There was a favorable clinical and analytical response.
Bronchofibroscopy was performed and displayed polypoid lesions in anterior trachea and a lesion in the right superior lobe compatible with breast cancer metastization. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed intense lymphocytosis (50.2%), with minor neutrophilia (7.6%). The CD4/CD8 ratio was slightly diminished (1.18). Cultures for bacterial, mycobacterial and Pneumocystis jiroveci were negative.
She was discharged on the 10th day, asymptomatic and no need of oxygen supplementation. Since there was already a strong suspicion of antineoplastic-induced lung injury she did not resume the same therapeutic scheme. Hormone therapy was restarted, with exemestane 25mg/day, without any HER-2 blockade.
The CT scan was repeated 15 days after the first one and did not show any of the alterations previously reported (Fig. 3).
She was followed in internal medicine consult for 3 months and kept her usual oncology consults, remaining asymptomatic."
"CASE DESCRIPTION
A 25-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to an Internal Medicine Department due to a history of myalgia, polyarthralgia, dry cough, pleuritic chest pain, vespertine high fever, fatigue and anorexia for 1-month. Polyarthralgia affecting small and large joints (shoulders, metacarpophalangeal, interphalangeal and ankles), was additive, symmetrical, and with typical inflammatory rhythm. Xerophthalmia, xerostomia and weight loss were denied. Her clinical symptoms did not improve after treatment with levofloxacin and ibuprofen.
There was no long-term medication history, recent travel or exposure to occupational and agricultural diseases. Recurrent infections or malignancy were not reported. Family history was negative for autoimmune or neoplastic diseases; however her mother and grandmother had an underinvestigated history of polyarthralgias.
Physical examination revealed petechial rash, spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and bi-basal lung rales. Her molar teeth had extensive caries lesions. The remainder physical examination was normal.
METHODS AND PROCEDURES
Laboratorial data revealed severe thrombocytopenia (4x109/L), microcytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.1g/dl and mean corpuscular volume of 75.7fl and leukopenia (3.4x109/L). Anti-platelet and indirect antiglobulin antibodies were detected. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated (42mm/h), C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 5mg/L and LDH of 772mg/dL. Liver and kidney function, thyroid hormones, electrolytes and urinary sediment were normal. She tested positive for adenovirus infection by adenovirus antigen test, but was negative for other viral antigen tests. Hematologic malignancies and sarcoidosis were excluded. Immunological study showed mild hypergammaglobulinemia. C3 and C4 were within normal range. Cryoglobulins and rheumatoid factor were not detected. Her autoantibody profile showed positive antinuclear antibodies (titer 1/640, homogeneous fluorescence pattern) with anti-SSA/Ro positivity. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide, double-stranded DNA and Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral parenchymal infiltrate in pulmonary bases (figure 1 and 2). SchirmerÂ´s test was negative. Salivary gland scintigraphy revealed functional absence of the submandibular glands (figure 3) and salivary gland biopsy revealed focal lymphocytic aggregates, with a focus score of 1 focus/4mm2 (figure 4).
An overlap syndrome was diagnosed, with features of SLE and SS. The patient was treated with prednisone 1mg/Kg daily and hydroxychloroquine. She showed marked clinical improvement and was discharged home on a tapering dose of prednisone.
DISCUSSION"
"CASE PRESENTATION
A 50-year-old male was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for septic shock due to pneumonia, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and aminergic support upon admission on the emergency department. Three days before, he started complaining of shortness of breath and abdominal pain, without fever; besides dizziness and blurred vision, no other neurological signs or symptoms were reported, namely neck stiffness or photophobia.
His past medical history was significant for heart transplantation 3 months before, due to ethylic dilated cardiomyopathy, without major immediate intercurrences. He was kept on an immunosuppressive regimen with tacrolimus 2mg b.i.d, prednisolone 10mg b.i.d and mycophenolate mofetil 1000mg b.i.d.
As he met sepsis criteria, broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage was initiated with meropenem (2gm IV q8h). On admission, relevant findings were a C-reactive protein of 33.25mg/dl (reference range: 0-0.5 mg/dl), white blood cell count of 19.8 x 109 /L (reference range: 4-10 x 109 /L), neutrophils of 16.4 x 109 /L (reference range: 2-7 x 109 /L). Chest radiograph showed middle lobe consolidation of right lung with interstitial infiltrates (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Chest radiograph with middle lobe consolidation of right lung with interstitial infiltrates.
P. aeruginosa was isolated in the first two sets of blood cultures, with susceptibility to ceftazidime and gentamycin and later, in endotracheal aspirate with the same resistance profile; as susceptibility to meropenem was not confirmed in both antibiotic susceptibility testing, ceftazidime (2gm IV q8h) and gentamicin (7mg/kg q24h) were initiated. After improvement of respiratory failure and suspension of sedo-analgesia, the patient maintained an altered state of consciousness (3 points in Glasgow Coma Scale). Acute cerebrovascular events and metabolic causes of coma were meticulously excluded. Electroencephalogram revealed severe diffuse encephalopathy. This finding was further explored with serial neuroimaging with cerebral computerized tomography that showed intra-ventricular purulent collection with linear ependymal enhancement, confirming ventriculitis (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Cerebral CT showed, besides areas of ischemia, intra-ventricular purulent collection with linear ependymal enhancement, confirming ventriculitis.
In this context, an extraventricular drain was placed revealing a densely cellular cerebrospinal fluid (leucocytes of 8000/mm3), with predominance of polymorphonuclear, glycorrhachia of 3mg/dl (range 40-70) and proteinorrhachia of 237mg/dl (range 15- 40) and with culture positive for P. aeruginosa susceptible only to gentamycin and colistin. Intrathecal gentamicin (8mg, q.d) and colistin (5-10mg q.d) were associated to previous intravenous antibiotics.
Besides invasive mechanical ventilation, the patient also benefited from vasoactive amines at an early stage. He was also treated with intravenous dexamethasone (4mg b.i.d) to minimize vasogenic oedema resulting from the cerebral inflammatory process as well as levetiracetam IV 1000mg, b.i.d. Immunosuppressants above referred were replaced by cyclosporine continuous perfusion. Nutritional support was ensured by enteric nutrition bag with adequate calorie and protein requirements considering the high catabolic state due to severe infection.
Despite optimized therapeutic measures, the outcome was fatal, and the patient died 13 days after ICU admission.
DISCUSSION"
"Case report
We present the case of a 65-year-old man with arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, past smoking, previous non-ST elevation myocardial infarction eight years earlier and a recent history of poor adherence to medication. He presented to the emergency department with typical angina that had awoken him. Other than high blood pressure (171/78 mmHg), physical examination at presentation was unremarkable. Initial electrocardiogram showed Q wave in V5, V6 and inferior leads (already present in previous electrocardiograms), a biphasic T wave in leads V3 and V4, flat T wave in V5, DII and aVF and a symmetric inverted T wave in DIII (Fig. 1). High-sensitivity troponin value was 194 ng/L at admission (reference value < 34,2 ng/L), with a maximum value of 37918 ng/L 12 hours later. Echocardiography showed biventricular preserved systolic function with basal inferior localized akinesia. A non-ST elevation myocardial infarction was diagnosed and early coronary angiography was performed revealing: a left coronary artery with diffuse ectasia (Fig. 2); a right dominant coronary artery, with diffuse ectasia and a thrombus on its middle and distal segments, which also involved the posterior descending artery (Fig. 3). No stent was implanted. Dual antiplatelet therapy (with aspirin and ticagrelor) and anticoagulation (with fondaparinux) was started. One week later, repeated coronary angiography showed significant reduction of thrombotic burden. Upon review of medical history, we found that the previous myocardial infarction was also due to a thrombus on the right coronary artery, and both right and left coronaries had already been ectatic. At the time, the patient was also treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and anticoagulation, followed by DATP for a year and then antiplatelet monotherapy with aspirin, which he had recently been taking inconsistently. We decided to prolong triple therapy for one more week and the patient was then discharged under DAPT. After six months of follow-up, no recurrent symptoms were observed.

"Case Description
We describe the case of a 59-year-old male patient admitted due to stridora month after being treated for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. His previous medical history was only remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, without known micro or macrovascular complications, with a good metabolic control; high blood pressure; dyslipidemia and regular alcohol consumption.
The patient was in his usual state of health until two weeks before he was admitted for the first time, when he started a dry cough and dysgeusia. At the emergency department (ED) he complained of progressively worsening shortness of breath on exertion. He denied fever, headache or myalgia. He denied previous similar episodes. He had not travelled recently nor did he have contact with anyone known to have COVID-19. The patient was tachycardic (heart rate 100bpm) with elevated blood pressure 166/91mmHg and feverish (tympanic temperature of 38.3 ºC). He was polypneic at rest, with a peripheral oxygen saturation of 92%. He presented crackles on the left lower pulmonary base and a chest x-ray with a bilateral patchy shadowing. No other imaging tests were used. He had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result for COVID-19.
The patient was then transferred to the infectious diseases ward where there was a progressive worsening of the respiratory failure during the first three days after admission. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to the need for mechanical ventilation. On that day he started therapy with remdesivir (10 days) and methylprednisolone 40mg every 12 hours for 5 days. No antibiotic therapy was started.
During his stay at the ICU, he presented a favorable evolution, requiring mechanical ventilation only for the first 5 days. He did not need to do any prone position periods and cuff leak test was negative. After extubation he did not need noninvasive ventilation. He started low-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and was transferred to the internal medicine ward and discharged 10 days after he was extubated (apparently without any complications). At discharge the patient was considered cured of the SARS-CoV-2 infection but maintained complaints of severe dry cough and odynophagia. Later at home, he referred hoarseness that he associated with the persistence of the cough. Twenty eight days after hospital discharge, and with persistent frequent and severe cough he developed dyspnea with a feeling of upper airway obstruction that progressively worsened, and the patient was readmitted to the ED due to dyspnea and stridor. Upon arrival at the ED, the patient was alert, oriented, hypertensive. Nasofibrolaryngoscopy was performed showing marked supraglottic edema and bilateral severe hypomobility of the vocal cords. Due to worsening of the clinical state, orotracheal intubation was performed. Cervico-thoracic CT was performed, showing diffuse edematous infiltration of the larynx, with diffuse edema of the visceral space of the neck, globosity of the parotids and submandibular glands; predominantly peripheral bilateral ground-glass pulmonary opacities with diffuse distribution and small peripheral subpleural areas of consolidating pulmonary parenchyma, predominantly in the lower lobes (Fig. 1 and 2).
Surgical tracheotomy was performed under general anesthesia and therapy with methylprednisolone 1mg/Kg/day was initiated. PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. His laboratory workout was unremarkable, apart from a high erythrocyte sedimentation ratio of 76mm/hr.
To exclude a central cause for the vocal cord paresis, he also underwent brain CT and brain MRI, which were unremarkable. He also performed an electromyography of the lower and upper limbs, to exclude any Guillain Barré syndrome, revealing only a mild myopathy associated with prolonged hospitalization. He completed 5 days of methylprednisolone 1mg/kg/day and subsequently started prednisolone 1mg/kg/day, having been discharged on a corticosteroid tapering regimen.
During hospitalization, two nasofibrolaryngoscopies were performed, the first after the end of 5 days of methylprednisolone, showing bilateral edema of the arytenoid folds, mainly on the right; paralysis of the right hemilarynx and hypomobility of the left hemilarynx, with reduced glottal cleft and the second on the 16th day of hospitalization, already under prednisolone 15mg/day (tapering scheme), without edema of the arytenoid and good mobility of the vocal cords. Before discharge, the tracheotomy was closed without complications.

"CASE PRESENTATION
An 86-year-old male, with a past medical history of tobacco consumption, colonic diverticulosis with two previous episodes of hospital admission with bleeding and symptomatic anaemia and a recent diagnosis of heart failure, medicated with ACEi, spironolactone and furosemide. He was admitted to our ward with a recent onset of nominal aphasia, depression, uncontrolled hypertension and glycaemia. On admission, physical examination revealed no other focal neurological deficit and showed signs of congestion, with pulmonary and peripheral oedema and mild hypoxemia (SpO2 89.5% with FiO2 21%). Blood work showed hypokalaemia (K+2.9 mEq/L, Mg2+1.84 mg/dL, Na+145 mEq/L, Cl-97 mEq/L) and metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.51; pCO2 48.6 mmHg; pO2 54 mmHg HCO3- 39 mmol/L). CT-angiography and head and neck doppler sonography showed no acute changes. With the initial supportive treatment with intravenous diuretic and potassium reposition, there was a transient clinical improvement of the neurological symptoms but progressive worsening of the oedema with persistent hypokalaemia, hypertension and hyperglycaemia. Further testing showed proteinuria in the nephrotic range, high levels of urinary potassium and high serum ACTH (328 pg/mL; reference: < 46 pg/mL) and cortisol (83.9 mg/dL; reference: < 50 mg/dL) as well as high 24h urinary excretion of cortisol (6812 mg/24 hours; reference: 4.3  176 mg/24 hours).
An ectopic ACTH production was confirmed by a failure of dexamethasone to suppress cortisol production (serum cortisol after 1 mg de dexamethasone: 67.5 mcg/dL; reference < 1.8 mcg/dL). Further brain imaging with MRI showed no signs of hypophyseal disease. A full body computerized tomography documented a 35 mm irregular mass in the left lung (hilum and lower lobe) with adjacent lymphadenopathy, suspicious of malignancy. (Figs. 1 and 2) Samples obtained via bronchial fibroscopy revealed a small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). The final diagnosis was a SCLC with ectopic ACTH production and associated Cushing Syndrome (CS).
The patient was started on metyrapone (doses up titrating to a maximum 1500 mg) and over the course of 2 weeks a reduction in cortisol production was observed, with the following quantitation of urinary excretion of cortisol 719 mg/24h (previous 6812 mg/24h) (Fig. 3). Other adjunctive therapies were added, including intravenous potassium replacement, diuretics, combined anti-hypertensives and insulin. Citalopram and clonazepam were started after psychiatric evaluation. After a multidisciplinary evaluation, the tumour was deemed unresectable and cytoreductive chemotherapy was indicated upon clinical stability. There was a progressive worsening of the clinical status, with refractoriness to the aforementioned measures and the patient died due to complications of disease progression.

"CASE REPORT
We report the case of a 47 year-old male with no relevant medical history. Since 2010 he developed cutaneous lesions, with 1-2mm, located in the trunk and limbs, erythematous, flat and slightly pruritic. Dermographism was not noticed (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). He also complained of recurrent bone pain along the lower limbs and occasionally asymptomatic self-limited fever. Laboratory and imaging finding were inconclusive for several years. Meanwhile, a skin biopsy was done revealing the existence of polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate. Since then he had been treated with corticoids and anti-histamine drugs, due to the assumption of chronic urticaria, reporting only a slight and temporary improvement on symptoms.
When we first observed him in 2014, he had cutaneous erythematous spots, hepatomegaly and palpable axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. The initial study revealed anaemia, leucocytosis, elevated sedimentation rate and immunoelectroforesis shown a discrete monoclonal peak (IgG/Kappa). A computed tomography scan was performed, which showed a 1.8cm axillary and a 1.5cm pelvic lymphadenopathies and a slight homogeneous hepatomegaly. The inguinal ganglion was excised (as it was the most easily accessible), whose histology was inconclusive. Given the hypothesis of a lymphoproliferative disease, a myelogram and bone morrow biopsy were also performed, showing the presence of all cells lines with normal density, location and maturation, with plasmocytic cells responsible for less than 5% of the cellular population. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed 7% of cells positive for del (17) (p13.1) and 16% positive for atypical pattern t (4;14).
After exclusion of others diseases, Schnitzler Syndrome was considered to be the most probable diagnosis. In this context, treatment with Anakinra was proposed and started on March 2015, at a standard dose of 100 mg daily.8,9
The day after the first subcutaneous injection, rash fever and pain subsided (Fig. 3). Analytically, he had normalization of the blood count, sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. We confirmed that he remained asymptomatic for a period of 60 hours (after which symptoms reappeared), so at this time Anakinra at alternate days was prescribed (this new scheme was stablishing for cost reasons).
In late October 2015, treatment was suspended. Despite being without therapy he remained pain free until April 2016, after which he experienced the reappearance of symptoms (skin spots, fever and pain). Anakinra was then reintroduced in July 2016, by another hospital, and all symptoms and signs disappeared again (Table 1).
The patient was recently observed at an appointment, three years after starting Anakinra. He referred that nowadays he can be asymptomatic for a period of up to 48hours. Fever and rash are de first symptoms to reaper but he can stay free from bone pain for up to a month. He also mentioned that in the past he had experienced some photosensitivity that resolved with the ongoing treatment.

"CLINICAL CASE:
A 44 year-old Brazilian woman, with no known past medical history, presented to an Emergency Department (ED) complaining of malaise, sore throat, myalgia and high-grade fever for a week. She was dismissed with the diagnosis of urinary tract infection, treated with Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole and later, due to persistent symptoms, amoxicillin/clavulanate. She was admitted in our ED as symptoms progressed, complaining of arthralgia and a fever-related evanescent non-pruritic maculopapular salmon-colored rash (Fig. 1), which started on her face, extending to the arms and legs, sparing palms and soles. The patient lived in a rural environment, having only sporadic contact with cattle. No other epidemiologically relevant data was identified. She mentioned dental manipulation two weeks previously to the beginning of the symptoms.
Physical examination revealed fever (39.3 ºC), an evanescent, non-petechial and non-pruritic, salmon-colored exanthema on her right arm. Left hand small joints, bilaterally and right knee joint were painful, warm and erythematous. No cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological or other alterations were noticed.
Laboratory findings revealed microcytic hypochromic anemia with hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL (reference value [RV] 12.0  15.3 g/dL), leukocytosis (13.6x109/L, RV 4.0  11.0x109/L) with neutrophil predominance (90.4%), elevated C - reactive protein (CRP) (32.4 mg/dL, RV <0.5 mg/dL) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm/1st h (RV < 12 mm/1st h). Albumin levels were decreased (3.1 g/dL, RV 3.5  5.2 g/dL), with normal liver enzymes. Chest roentgenogram and urinalysis were unremarkable.
She was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department as zoonosis was suspected. She was started on doxycycline, with noticeable oscillating CRP levels and maintenance of low to moderate-grade fever, as further investigations proceeded. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a filamentous structure hinting at aortic valve vegetation and empiric treatment for infective endocarditis was started with no benefit to the patient status. Later, transoesophageal echocardiogram revealed Lambl excrescence, discarding the previous diagnosis. Hemocultures and urine cultures were negative. Serology for Brucella, Rickettsia, Lyme disease, Leptospira, Syphilis and antistreptolysin O titers were also negative. Hepatitis virus and HIV were negative.
As she developed dyspnea, cough and lower oxygen saturations needing oxygen therapy, a chest CT was ordered which revealed bilateral axillary and right pulmonary hilum lymphadenopathies, pericardial effusion, multifocal bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes and bilateral pleural effusion. Abdomen CT showed hepatosplenomegaly and moderate quantity of peritoneal fluid. Thoracocentesis revealed a cloudy sterile transudate with predominance of macrophages. No malignant cells were found neither on pleural fluid nor on bronco-alveolar lavage fluid. Lung and pleural biopsies harvested through flexible bronchofibroscopy and percutaneously, respectively, were normal as well.
On anemia studying we found iron metabolism compatible with iron deficiency, while ferritin levels were high (687 ng/mL, RV 13  150 ng/mL), suggesting chronic inflammatory component to the anemia. Folic acid levels were also low. Glycosylated ferritin levels were 28%. Bone marrow biopsy revealed no morphological or maturative abnormalities and PET scan showed no abnormal hypermetabolic foci. Auto-immune markers were also negative. Finding no evidence of infection, malignancy or another auto-immune disorder, we considered the diagnosis of adult-onset Still disease. Symptoms subsided when she was started on indomethacin, the body temperature profile normalized; she was dismissed, and started being followed in external consultation.
Due to gastric complaints, she underwent endoscopy which showed antral gastropathy, bulbitis and duodenitis. Duodenal biopsies revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and intra-epithelial T lymphocytes which suggested celiac disease. Anti-transglutaminase (IgA), anti-gliadin (IgA and IgG) were positive. She was started on gluten-free diet and stopped indomethacin after six months. Due to remarkably favorable response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, usual progression to corticosteroids and corticoid-sparing immunosuppressant for moderate to severe disease was avoided. After more than 2 years of follow-up, she remains symptom free until today.
DISCUSSION"
"Case Report
A 49-year-old man with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking habits was admitted to the emergency department for presenting acroparesthesia and paraparesis with one week of evolution and progressive worsening.
On admission, he was slimmed and with fever. Neurologic examination disclosed a grade 4 paraparesis (Medical Research Council scale) with a predominance of deficit in knee flexion and finger extension, hypoesthesia in a stocking-glovepattern, kinesthesia, pallesthesia, proprioceptive errors, abolished deep-tendon reflexes in the lower limbs and ataxic gait. Muscle strength in the upper limbs was preserved and cutaneous plantar reflex was indifferent bilaterally. No meningeal signs, diarrhea, odynophagia, oropharyngeal lesions, or any other signs or symptoms of infection.
The results of CT of the brain were normal. The examination of the CSF revealed albuminocytological dissociation.
Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin has been started in a regimen of 0.4 g/kg daily for five days, which resulted in improvement of the motor component but without improvement of sensory disturbances.
Electromyography performed on the fourteenth day after the onset of symptoms revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy of sensory predominance, of primarily axonal character, with relatively symmetrical and distance-dependent attainment pattern, of moderate severity and subacute installation.
The clinical diagnosis of GBS in its acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) form was made. Physical therapy was initiated early during hospitalization with gradual improvement of the motor component of neuropathy.
A comprehensive etiological study was conducted. On blood testing, inflammatory markers were increased, with a total white cell count of 22.9x109/L and C reactive protein 251.7mg/L. Serologies for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, syphilis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia and Campylobacter jejuni were negative. Blood and CSF cultures were negative. Onconeuronal antibodies were negative and IgM autoantibodies against ganglioside GM3 were borderline (with non-reactive IgG). The presence of spinal cord injuries was excluded by MRI of the dorsal and lumbar spine. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed: no white mucosal plaque-like lesions were noted but an exophytic and ulcerated neoplastic lesion was found in the upper esophagus. The histological examination was consistent with moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The echoendoscopy performed for cancer staging showed an infiltrative lesion involving the entire esophageal wall. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed thickening and irregularity of the esophageal wall and locoregional lymph nodes with characteristics compatible with metastatic infiltration. The diagnosis of locally advanced esophageal cancer with suspicious paraesophageal adenopathies was made.
At the time of discharge, the patient did not present improvement of the sensory component of neuropathy but was capable of autonomous gait, although with a widened base of support and in need of supervision.
The treatment plan was established interdisciplinary, and the patient was proposed to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with cisplatin plus fluorouracil. Restaging after CRT revealed pulmonary metastases and, after chemotherapy with docetaxel, disease progression has been found. On neurologic examination, the patient kept lower limbs dysesthesia and areflexia. He was proposed for palliative treatment and died about 2 years after the initial diagnosis.

"Clinical Case
An 87-year-old man, with Parkinsons disease, was referred to the Emergency Room with a history of sudden appearance of jaundice and a pruritic rash, affecting the back, chest, abdomen, arms and legs, with 24-48 hours of evolution. The patient also complained of nausea and vomiting. On admission, he was afebrile and stable, but presented with jaundice of scleras and skin, and with a diffuse maculopapular rash, affecting the described areas, that disappeared when pressed. Abdomen was innocent, as was the rest of his physical examination.
His laboratory findings showed a cholestatic pattern of liver injury (R value of 0.75): total bilirubin (TB) 302 µmol/L, with conjugated bilirubin of 217.9 µmol/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 1148 U/L; gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 1069 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 852 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 470 U/L. C-reactive protein, serum eosinophil percentage, amylase and lipase were normal. His abdominal ultrasound and CT were normal, making our main diagnostic hypothesis of biliary obstruction less likely. Despite this, the patient was admitted, and then submitted to a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, also normal. Different laboratory studies were performed, to exclude other potential diagnoses: hepatitis A, B, C and E serologies; CMV, HSV, EBV and HIV serologies; serum proteinogram and immunoglobulin levels; autoantibodies (antinuclear; anti-smooth muscle; anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies; anti-soluble liver antigen; anti-mitochondrial); copper serum level; and transferrin saturation.
During the 1st week of hospitalization, the patients liver enzymes showed a progressive fall, except for the TB, that reached a value of 546.5 µmol/L. Clinically, no more nausea or vomit occurred, but the patients jaundice (expectably) aggravated, the same happening to the rash, with appearance of pustules, that raised the possibility of an Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), confirmed with a skin biopsy.
Given the clinical picture and the absence of other apparent causes to it (all the laboratory study above mentioned was normal), DILI became our main diagnostic hypothesis. The patient was previously medicated with Levodopa/Carbidopa 200/50 mg 3 times/day for over a year. No other drugs (particularly antibiotics and pain killers), herbs or xenobiotics were consumed recently, except for Furosemide (60 mg/day) and Spironolactone (25 mg/day), both initiated 8 weeks before the beginning of the symptoms, for heart failure purposes. These drugs had been discontinued on the patients 1st day of admission and, apart from the TB increase, he was, indeed, showing some signs of improvement. However, on the 10th day of hospitalization, the transaminases suffered a marked rise, specially the AST (3019 U/L), a tendency maintained during the following days, with a switch in the pattern of liver injury (to a hepatocellular pattern; R value of 10.17). An ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was then performed, revealing no signs of chronic liver disease and a mixed pattern of liver injury with intrahepatic (hepato-canalicular) cholestasis, with spotty acidophilic necrosis (Fig. 1), suggesting two main differential diagnosis: toxic/drug induced or sepsis/systemic infection. Since the patient was never septic or infected, DILI was assumed as the cause of the liver disease.
Given the clinical history and temporality, both Furosemide and Spironolactone were considered as the main potential causes for this DILI. Based on LiverTox database, Spironolactone seemed the most probable drug involved, even more so after the restart of Furosemide without worsening of the clinical picture or the liver biochemistry. The diagnosis of DILI secondary to Spironolactone was then assumed. The patient evolved favorably and was discharge, after three months, with no jaundice, with normal levels of transaminases and TB, and with levels of ALP of 375 U/L (Fig. 2). The AGEP disappeared progressively without any specific treatment.
